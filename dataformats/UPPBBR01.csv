$UPPBBR01,text,8,"this is the identifier for the start of the UPPBBR01 UDP packet"
packet_length,>unsigned_int,3,"the length of the packet (not including all characters up-to the comma which follows this number)"
utc_time,>unsigned_int,10,"the valid time for this packet (usually 1 second behind actual time)"
ptp_sync,boolean,1,"indication of whether the CRIO is successfully synchronised to PTP time ( 1 = synced, 0 = not-synced )"
crio_temp,>unsigned_int,3,"the internal hardware temperature of the CRIO"
flight_num,text,5,"indicates the flight number for this packet ( an ""empty"" string here indicates that the CRIO hasn't been assigned a flight number )"
crio_fpga_run,boolean,1,"indicates whether the FPGA code is running ( a value toggling e.g. 1-0-1-0 etc shows running code, fixed value = non running )"
crio_rtc_run,boolean,1,"indicates whether the realtime code is running ( a value toggling e.g. 1-0-1-0 etc shows running code, fixed value = non running )"
crio_status,boolean,1,"- currently unused but for future use (boolean, therefore 0,1 )"
crio_UDP_num,>unsigned_int,6,"this number starts @ zero and increments with each UDP packet - used for verification of packet stream"
crio_mem_used,text,3,"a string to represent the percentage of CRIO hard disk currently used"
crio_disktype,text,3,"- Which disk is being used, INT = internal flash : USB = usb flash drive : --- = NODATA!"
crio_aux_out3,text,6,"- currently unused but for future use ( text, max string size = 6 characters )"

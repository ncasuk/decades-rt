Format of entries in this file:

All lines not beginning with CAL are ignored.
Column eight contains the number of constants for the parameter.
Lines starting with CALnnn may contain up to six constants for calibrating DRS
parameter nnn.  Each entry may be in any convenient floating point format but
MUST be terminated by a comma. Entries are in order x0,x1,...
* means unchanged from previous version (as yet...)

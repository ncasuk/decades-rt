                                                                1st May  1998
Circuit Breakers required

JB2  28V DC  "Filters"
JB11 200VAC 3ph  "Filter Pump"  (on Equipment Rack)
                                                                           
                                                                           

Pre-flight Checks
1.  Check correct Filter housings are fitted for the type of filter packs.
    (Large housings - 90mm filter packs, small housings - 47mm filter packs).
2.  Make 2 CBs.
3.  Switch Electronics Unit ON (switch located on rear of unit).  The 2
    displays on the front panel will start counting up, this is normal.
    During warmup, the rate of counting should decrease and the numbers will
    stabilise after about 20 minutes.
4.  Unlatch the upper housing and remove the Filter Holders.  Check that there
    are no filters fitted or obstructions in the housing.                  
    Check that the pipework is connected securely to the back of the filter
    housing.  Clip the filter housing back onto the inlet, this should be a
    good tight fit.                                                        
5.  Repeat 4. for lower filter housing.                                    
6.  Open the 2 Inlets (handles horizontal).                                
7.  Open the 2 Downstream Valves (on Electronics Unit tray - red and blue).
8.  Switch the Pump ON (Electronics Unit, front panel).  The Pump can normally
    be heard from the fwd cargohold.  If you can't hear it, go to the Equip.
    Rack and check that it is running.
9.  If satisfied that Pump operating satisfactorily, switch Pump OFF.
10. Zero the Flow Counters (Elec. Unit, red buttons beside displays).
11. Close the Inlets (handles vertical).
12. Close the Downstream Valves (red and blue).
13. Switch the Electronics Unit OFF.
14. Check there are sufficient loaded Filter Holders and bags for the flight. 
15. Secure a box to a nearby shelf for in-flight storage of the filters.



After Take-off
1.  Check Electronics Unit ON (F.Leader will normally do this pre-takeoff).
2.  It takes about 20 minutes for the Flow Counters to stabilise.  (Filter
    sampling should not start until they are stable).



Before Run
1.  Insert loaded Filter Holder(s) into the housing(s).  Note down the Filter
    Holder number(s) and the inlet number in the Flight Log.  Relatch the
    housings and check secure.


During Run
1.  At the start of the run, OPEN both of the Inlets (handles horizontal).
2.  OPEN the Downstream Valves (red and blue).
3.  ZERO the Flow Counters and switch the Pump ON.
4.  Fill in the rest of the flight log.
5.  Label a plastic bag for the filter(s) being exposed.
    (Flight No, Run No, Filter Holder No).
6.  Monitor the flow counts, if one is significantly higher than the other, 
    the filter may have split. Inform Scientist / replace filter accordingly.

                                                                1st May  1998
End of Run
1.  Switch the Pump OFF.                   
2.  CLOSE the Downstream Valves.
3.  CLOSE the Inlets.
4.  Note down the flow counts in the Flight Log.
5.  Unlatch the housing(s) and carefully remove the Filter Holder(s). 
    Seal exposed Filter Holders in bags and store in box.
6.  Load clean filters as required.



    There are 4 analogue outputs which are recorded by the DRS at 1Hz.  These
    are as follows:-
           
        DRS Para.    Signal                   DRSU         Range

	195 F1FL  Inlet 1 Flow Rate          0 - 4095    0 to 400lpm
	196 F1PR  Inlet 1 Vacuum Pressure  409 - 2457    ambient to -1 atm.
 	197 F2FL  Inlet 2 Flow Rate          0 - 4095    0 to 400lpm
	198 F2PR  Inlet 2 Vacuum Pressure  409 - 2457    ambient to -1 atm.



On Return Transit, when no longer required
1.   Check Pump OFF.
2.   CLOSE both Inlets.
3.   CLOSE both Downstream Valves.
4.   Switch Electroncis Unit OFF.
5.   Break JB11 CB and JB2 CB.    


After Landing
1.  Remove filters from the Aircraft and return them to MRF.  
    (On detachments, store filters somewhere clean, cool, dry and dark).

                OPERATION OF IN CLOUD TEMPERATURE PROBE (ICTP)

Principles of Operation

The In-Cloud Temperature Probe measures the difference between the radiation
emitted by the atmosphere and by an internal black body at a known
temperature.  This raw difference signal is converted to air temperature by
applying formulae incorporating housekeeping data and experimentally derived
constants.

Radiation Measurement

A reflective chopper, driven by a 24,000rpm hysteresis motor, is used to chop
between samples of atmospheric and black body radiation.  The incoming samples
pass through two filters before reaching the infra-red detector.  The first
filter selects a narrow wavelength band centered at 4.26µm and the second,
blocks off the shorter wave, solar radiation.

A germanium lens focuses the radiation onto the detector.  The detector output
is amplified and the difference signal extracted by phase-sensitive detection. 
The instrument's operational temperature range is -50°C to +30°C.

Ice Detection

Radiation from an LED is directed through the chopper towards the external
viewing aperture at 1/16th chopping frequency.  The presence of ice would
cause some of this radiation to be reflected back into the instrument where it
would then be detected by a photo-diode and phase-sensitive detector.
This signal is recorded and forms part of the house-keeping data.

Data Logging

The raw radiance difference signals are logged at 32Hz on DRS channel 48. 
The calculated air temperatures alternating with the house-keeping data are
logged at 8Hz on channel 49.

Initial Test Flights

1.   Before Flight Checks

Switch on
a.   Ensure DRS clock is running
b.   Make 400Hz 3 phase circuit breaker on JB5 `ICTP' (JB4 200V)
c.   Make 28V circuit breaker on JB4B `ICTP'
d.   For several minutes warm up time, the output (channels 48 or 49) will
     show some unsynchronised readings whilst the majority are zero
e.   When operating temperature is reached the chopper motor will switch on
     and the data on the DRS will synchronise.  Channel 48 on DRS will show
     32Hz radiance data, all the same with some noise on the lower bits. 
     Channel 49 will show 8Hz multiplexed data with similar values in columns
     2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 with sub-multiplexed values in columns 1 and 5.
     The motor will be audible beneath the starboard maxipod.

                                                             8 February 1991

f.   Break 28V CB to set ICTP to standby.
     Break 200V CB (JB5).
     This will switch off the chopper motor although the electronics will
     continue to run.
     NOTE:  In order to operate the ICTP, the following supplies are required

          115V 400Hz 3ph
          28V DC
          1Hz DRS Clock
          Serial data request pulses from DRS via SIMON.

2.   After Take-Off

     Make 200V CB JB5
     Make 28V CB in JB4B `ICTP'

     Allow several minutes (10-15) warm up time.
     Check ICTP on DRS as detailed in 1d) and e).
     NOTE:  Some difficulty may be experienced in trying to check the
            audibility of the chopper motor in flight.

3.   Pre-Landing Checks

     Switch off ICTP:
     a.   Break 28V CB on JB4B `ICTP'
     b.   Break 115V 400Hz 3ph ON JB5A `ICTP'

General Notes

1.   The instrument can be run from before take-off to after landing without
     suffering any harm.  It is switched to standby to conserve the life of
     the chopper motor.

2.   No harm will come to the instrument if flown unpowered.

                    the Total Temp. Sensor Heater switch is OFF)

Principles of Operation

The de-iced temperature element is a platinum resistance thermometer. The
resistance of the platinum wire within the element alters in relation to the
changes in the air temperature. The signal output from the sensor enters an
interface board in MILLIE where it is converted into DRS units and split into
two parameters : 10 - coarse deiced temperature and 11 - fine deiced
temperature.

When the deicing heater is on, software on HORACE and on TARDIS applies
corrections to the data to take account of the heater's effect.

Pre Flight
1.   Check temperature probe clean and undamaged.
2.   Press to test the heater ON indicator light.  Check it illuminates.
3.   Make CB JB4A and switch the Total Temp. Sensor Heater ON and check:
     a)   De-iced temperature sensor warms.
     b)   Signal Register Para 27 bit 25 changes from 1 to 0.
     c)   Parameter 10 indicates increasing temperature.
4.   Switch Total Temp. Sensor Heater OFF.
IF THE HEATER IS LEFT ON, ON THE GROUND, DAMAGE WILL OCCUR.

In Flight 

1.   After take-off, if the aircraft is in icing conditions, switch the Total
     Temp. Sensor Heater ON. 
2.   Once the aircraft has emerged from the icing conditions, switch the Total
     Temp. Sensor Heater OFF. 
3.   Prior to landing, break heater CB on JB4A.

Post Flight 

1.   Check temperature probe is clean and undamaged. 
2.   After low level flights the temperature elements should be sprayed with
     distilled water followed by methylated spirit to clear any salt deposits. 
     During winter use meths. only.

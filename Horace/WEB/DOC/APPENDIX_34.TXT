                      BENDIX OZONE ANALYSER (Now replaced by the TECO instrument)

Circuit Breakers Required

Forward Bulkhead:-   MRF Main Distribution Panel
                     a.  230V JB11 SUPPLY (two circuit breakers)
Rear Cargo Hold:-    JB11A
                     a.  230V CB `CERL TRANS'
               :-    L.H.S. Climbing frame
                     a.  3A fuse `332 3A'

Principles of Operation

Sample air is mixed with ethylene, from an external cylinder, which produces a
chemiluminescent reaction.  The wavelengths emitted are detected by a
photomultiplier.  The output from the photomultipler is amplified to produce
the output on the meter dial which is proportional to the amount of ozone in
the air sample.

Pre-Flight

1.   SPAN and ZERO potentiometers should NOT be adjusted.
2.   The TIME CONSTANT switch should be left on 1sec for normal operation.
3.   Turn the valve on the ethylene cylinder ON and pressurize to 50lb/in2.
4.   Check the Ethylene cylinder for leaks with `snoop'.
5.   Turn the POWER and the PUMP ON.
6.   Make sure that the PUMP BYPASS is closed for CERL flights.
7.   The SAMPLE AND ETHYLENE flow rate should read 28.
8.   The ETHYLENE pressure should read 22.
9.   The MODE switch should be on AMBIENT, turn the MODE switch to ZERO.
10.  Turn the RANGE switch to 0.01 and leave the instrument to warm up for an
     hour.
11.  Turn the MODE switch to SPAN, and the RANGE switch to 0.2 and leave for
     half-an-hour.
12.  Check the meter reading is mid-range and note both of the flow readings
     and the meter reading.
13.  Turn the MODE switch to AMBIENT for 5 minutes.
14.  Turn the PUMP, the POWER and ETHYLENE OFF for take-off.

In-Flight

1.   Turn the ETHYLENE, PUMP and POWER ON.
2.   For normal operation:-   MODE switch to AMBIENT
                              RANGE switch to 0.2
3.   BEFORE LANDING or at the end of experimental flight, switch the PUMP,
     POWER and ETHYLENE OFF.

NOTE:  A full bottle of ethylene should last for at least 5 flights - if far
more ethylene is being used a leak in the system is indicated, the PUMP, POWER
and ETHYLENE should be switched OFF.

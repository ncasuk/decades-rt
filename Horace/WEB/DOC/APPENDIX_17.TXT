Power
1.   Herc Rack 5  - 230V Distribution box - Neph
					  - Neph Pump


Principles of Operation  (see attached pages)


Pre-flight
1.  Check Pipework.  Black intake pipe from ASP to inlet, Outlet pipe via pump.
2.  OPEN Starboard Air Sampling Pipes (use the adapter handle for the inlet).
3.  Make CBs and switches on EPDB 12.
4.  On Herc Rack 5 Distribution Box, switch Neph ON
                                     switch Neph Pump ON
5.  The three leds on the front of the Nephelometer should light up.
6.  Check the Neph parameters on the DRS / HORACE.

	DRS Para	HORACE Para  		Signal

 	175  NPRS	620  NEPH PRS           Sample Pressure
	176  NTMP	621  NEPH TMP		Sample Temperature
	177  NBTS	622  NEPH BTS		Total Scat. Blue
	178  NGTS	623  NEPH GTS		Total Scat. Green
	179  NRTS	624  NEPH RTS		Total Scat. Red 
	180  NBBS	625  NEPH BBS		Back Scat. Blue
	181  NGBS	626  NEPH GBS		Back Scat. Green
	182  NRBS	627  NEPH RBS		Back Scat. Red 
	183  NHUM	628  NEPH HUM           Sample Humidity
	184  NSTS	629  NEPH STS 		Status

    The following points should establish if the instrument is working properly.
     a)	The pressure, temperature and humidity values should be close to 
        ambient. 
     b)	The three Total Scattering signals should be the same shape and in size
        order be Blue, Green, Red.  (Blue having the highest value).
     c)	The Back Scattering signals are typically an order of magnitude less 
        than the Total Scattering ones.  Again they should be of the same 
        general shape and in terms of signal size, be in the order Blue, Green
        then Red.  A Zero Cal. should be done if not.
        (The status signal is mainly used for flagging data during processing). 


7.   A Zero Calibration can give another indication that the instrument is
     working properly.  This can be done from any HORACE display.  
    	Select Option 17 - Instruments.
        Select Option  5 - Nephelometer.  
        Select Option  1 - Zero calibration to start the cal.
     During the calibration, all scattering signals will remain at the values
     they had immediately prior to the Cal.  The time taken for a Zero 
     Calibration is currently set at 5 minutes.  Note values in Flight Log.

8.   On HR5 Distribution box, switch Neph Pump OFF
                              switch Neph OFF.
9.   Close 2 Starboard Air Sampling Pipes (use T-bar for the inlet).



After take-off
1.  OPEN Starboard Air Sampling Pipes.
2.  Check CBs and switches made on EPDB 12.
3.  On Herc Rack 5 Distribution Box, switch Neph ON
                                     switch Neph Pump ON.
4.  The main requirement in-flight is to perform a Zero Calibration at every 
    new level.  This is normally done either before the start or after the end
    of a Run.  Check with the Scientist as to which is preferred.  
*** IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THERE IS NO CHANGE IN HEIGHT DURING A CAL. *** 
    If there is, then this should be noted in the log and the Scientist 
    informed.  It will probably be necessary to do it again. 

5.  Monitor signals on HORACE and print off Scatter Channels' plot periodically
    (or note down levels), and log Calibration times.



On Return Transit, when no longer required
1.  On HR5 Dist. box, switch Neph Pump OFF
                      switch Neph OFF. 
2.  Check with other Operators before breaking CBs.
3.    "    "     "       "       "    closing ASPs.



After Flight
1.   A Zero Calibration may be required on the ground after power changeover.
2.   Check all ASPs closed and CBs broken before leaving aircraft.

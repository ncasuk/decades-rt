                          GASP PROBE AND ALLEVIATOR

Circuit Breakers Required

1.   Cargo hold foward bulkhead - MRF Main Distribution Panel.

     a)   28v DC      -  JB3A

     b)   115/200v AC -  JB3A  A0

2.   Forward Fuselage - Starboard Side - JB3A

     a)   28v DC      -  Alleviator

     b)   115v AC 10  -  Particulate sampling.

Principles of Operation

The GASP probe extends into the airstream outside the aircraft boundary layer. 
With a TAS of 195 kts ie 100 ms-1 it decelerates this air to 10 ms-1.  A
secondary sample pipe protrudes into the slow speed airstream and the
alleviator pump is used to draw air isokinetically into the alleviator sample
volume.

At altitudes below 10,000 ft the aircraft may be depressurised.  Air can be
continuously drawn through the alleviator and respective particulate
instruments use their own sample pumps to draw air from the alleviator into
their sample volumes.  However with the aircraft at high altitude the sampled
air has to be brought up to the cabin pressure before this can be done.  The
bladder/bag inside the alleviator is allowed to fill with cabin air. 
Equilibrium is eventually reached with the air in the sample volume at cabin
pressure.

The GASP capping control lever is below the boom compartment.  The alleviator
actuator, pump and solenoid valves are operated by toggle switches on the
alleviator control box.

Pre-Flight

1.   Open GASP capping and check sample ports clear of obstructions.

2.   Check pipework, operation of actuator, solenoid valves, hand-valves and
     sample pump.

3.   Obtain sample (see below) and check operation of associated particulate
     sampling instruments.  (See relevant appendices).

4.   Switch pump and solenoid valves off.  Close actuator and cap GASP probe.

In-Flight

1.   Obtain permission to open GASP capping.

2.  Obtaining sample air - in both the presurised and de-pressurised cases
     that follow, we start from the point where the GASP probe has been
     un-capped, the control box has power but all other switches are in the
     off position.  The hand-valve on the exhaust side of the pump should be
     fully open.  The second hand-valve, downstream of the flow calibrated
     airspeed indicator (ASI), is used to control the flow rate through the
     system ie maintain isokinetic sampling.

                                               the alleviator.
     a.   (i)  ACTUATOR SHUT

               PUMP ON
                                               The sample volume is exhausted
                                               and the bladder fills the 
                                               evacuated space.

          (iii) THE PRESSURE IN THE ALLEVIATOR  Monitor the pressure gauge.

                                                To take a sample from the
                                                atmosphere.

                                                other end of the alleviator.

          (iv) WAIT TWO MINUTES                 Available sample volume filled
                                                with outside air.

                                                the bladder which thus
                                                compresses the sample until
                                                equilibrium is reached.

                                                                22 August 1989

          (v)  PARTICULATE INSTRUMENTS          If pressure in alleviator

               SAMPLE VOLUME                    sampling from it, the
                                                contents are exhausted.  A new
                                                sample should be taken. 

                                                Repeat a-c as required.

4.   OBTAINING A SAMPLE WHEN THE AIRCRAFT IS DE-PRESSURISED

     a.   (i)  ACTUATOR OPEN
          (ii) PUMP ON
          (iii) PURGE ON
          (iv) VENT ON
          (v)  ADJUST HAND VALVE TO GIVE
               ASI READING OF 60 KTS.

          (vi) SAMPLE ON                        Bladder is permanently
                                                collapsed.  Outside air is
                                                continuously drawn through the
                                                alleviator.  Cabin, alleviator
                                                and atmospheric pressure are
                                                all equal.  Particulate
                                                instruments may sample
                                                continuously.

5.   When sampling complete.  Switch pump and solenoid valves off.  Close
     actuator and cap GASP probe.  Break circuit breakers on JB3A.

Problems
1.   The alleviator pump can overheat if over-worked and an occasional check
     should be made of its temperature.  This problem may be obviated by
     switching the pump off when not absolutely required.

2.   If the aircraft is to be pressurised it would be useful if a cabin
     altitude of not less than 2000 ft were set.  This ensures the alleviator
     sample pressure stays within the pressure gauge calibration.

3.   It should be noted that the GASP probe has been optimised for a free
     stream velocity ie true airspeed of 100 ms-1.  Large deviations from this
     can lead to errors in size distribution and particle concentrations.

4.   Splitting of the alleviator bag/bladder can occur.  The system will not
     be able to bring the sample volume up to cabin pressure.  If this happens
     rectification will not be possible in-flight, so the system should be
     declared unserviceable and shut down.

5.   The solenoid valves can be subject to sticking.  Light tapping on the
     valve housing may release them otherwise the system should be declared
     unserviceable and shut down.  Dirt can also cause these valves not to
     seat properly - spares for overhauling these items are held by MRF.

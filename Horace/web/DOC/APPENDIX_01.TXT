     Switch OUTPUT ON.
     After ~10 secs 230V Power will become available.

2. Switch Monitors as required from Video Distribution Panel (H408) and  Video
Switching Panel (H500)

3.   Check Red light illuminated on keyboard

4.   When the DRS is Initialised proceed with the Pre-Flight checks of
     relevant parameters.

5.   Check Event Markers increment on the DRS.

     Located:  a)   Aircraft Scientist's Position - overhead
               b)   Navigator's Position - below bench
               c)   Air Sampling Pipe Position
               d)   Manual Hygrometer Position
               e)   Air Sampling Boom Position
               f)   Van Forward Compartment (4)
               g)   Van Rear Compartment (2)
               h)   Navaid Position
               i)   Drop Sonde Control Panel (if uncovered).

6.   Type DATA to start recording, before Taxying.

IN FLIGHT:

1.   Monitor VDU to ensure GMT and Event are incrementing.

2.   Check parameters as required.

AFTER LANDING:

1. When aircraft stationary, but before power changeover, type HOLD to stop DRS
sending data to HORACE.

                     INITIALISING THE MICRO PROCESSOR DRS

THIS MUST BE CARRIED OUT AT THE START OF A FLIGHT OR IN A SITUATION WHERE THE
SYSTEM HAS BEEN RESET DURING A FLIGHT.

All commands and replies should be followed by (return).

When you are asked to reply YES or NO, if the answer you type is not YES it
will assume it to be NO.

Any instructions to 'INFORM ELECTRONICS' are obviously for when the aircraft
is on the ground.  In the air you must just keep restarting, if you are
unsuccessful, return to base is the only answer. It is not always necessary to
reset the DRS itself.(Indeed once the DRS has been initialised this should be
regarded as a last resort.) If the serial parameters are concerned it is now
possible to reset the SIMON interface (see Appendix A for more details).  

1.   PRESS the RESET button on the left hand side of the keyboard a * should
appear in the top left hand corner of the screen.
If not press the RESET button again.
If nothing happens and ALL ELSE FAILS pull the CB for the DRS on the 28V panel
Remake it and press the RESET button on the keyboard again.
2.   Type G8000 (return) This starts the DRS program

     TEST                These should be in RED GREEN BLUE & WHITE
     TEST                It indicates that all the colours are working
     TEST                If any of them are missing - INFORM ELECTRONICS!
(In flight the DRS will still record.  However, messages in the defective
colour will not appear in any other.  Press RESET and try again.)

DORIS MEMORY ALL OK!     All the memory used for writing to has been written
                         to and read from successfully

If the memory check fails then the following message appears:

DORIS MEMORY FAILED!!    Indicates that part of the memory cannot be written
INFORM ELECTRONICS       to so inform Electronics!
*                        You may try initialisation from STEP 1

INITIALISE INSTRUMENTS   Indicates all necessary instruments are initialised,
                         such as A/Ds, EVENT reset to 0 etc.
The following message may appear:

**SERIAL FAILED**        The SERIAL board is either not fitted or not 
                         responding properly.
                         The SERIAL Micro transmits MCR, IN CLOUD TEMP PROBE,
                         INS, OMEGA, FLUORESCENCE WATER VAPOUR SENSOR, TOTAL
                         WATER CONTENT and BBR data to the DRS.  If these are
                         needed on the flight, Electronics should be informed
                         that the SERIAL has failed! Reset the SIMON interface 
                         and try re-initialising from STEP 1.


ISS CODE = nnnn          These numbers must be identical and correspond to the
DBF CODE = nnnn          value given by the ELECTRONICS Section.  (Note these
                         values are in Hex.)

3.   IC CODE = 2   

4.   FLIGHT NO (Annn):   Type in the flight number including the letter.  This
                         will appear in the top left hand corner of the
                         screen.  Certain checks for validity are carried out. 
                         If the checks fail 'INVALID INPUT' will be given and
                         you will be asked FLIGHT NO again.
ARE YOU SURE (YES/NO):   This is an opportunity to correct the number you have
                         just typed in.     

5.   DATE (DD:MM:YY):    Type in the DATE in the form requested.  This will
                         appear below the Flight Number.  Certain checks for
                         validity are carried out.  If the check fails
                         'INVALID INPUT' will be given and you will be asked
                         DATE again.
ARE YOU SURE (YES/NO):   This is an opportunity to correct the number you have
                         just typed in.

6.   GMT (HH:MM:SS):     Type in GMT in the form requested.  Certain checks
                         for validity are carried out.  (If the checks fail
                         'INVALID INPUT' will be given and you will be asked
                         DATE again.)  The clock will be initialised with this
                         time when you type (return).  The GMT will appear in
                         the centre of the screen.  The Event Mark and its GMT
                         will appear below it.  

If the GMT display does not start updating after a 2 second delay you must
repeat the initialisation procedure from STEP 1.

ARE YOU SURE (YES/NO):   This is an opportunity to correct the GMT you have
                         just set up. 
The HELP command is then executed to give you a list of all the commands
available for use.

The Event Marks around the aircraft may be used at this stage and will
increment on the Flight Leader Display.


A SUMMARY OF THE FACILITIES AVAILABLE ON THE DATA RECORDING SYSTEM (ie (DORIS)

NOTES ON SELECT RATES

When you give the Para Number you require, a message appears in the form
     SAMPLE RATE= nn CR or NEW RATE (nn) =

This gives you the chance to reduce the sample rate at which the data will be
displayed.

If you type (RETURN) the rate will remain as the rate at which the parameter
is sampled for recording.

If you wish to reduce the rate the number you type will become the rate at
which you sample the data for plotting (the record rate remains the same).

This new sample rate must be a power of 2 (ie. 1 2 4 8 16 32 or 64).

NOTES ON PLOTTING

Graphs only represent the 8 last significant bits of the data.

The Y axis is the DECIMAL value of the last 8 bits of the data.

The X axis is marked with the number of seconds from the start of the plot and
annotated with:

     The value (all 12 bits) of the first point plotted in HEX & DECIMAL
     The GMT at the start of the plot
     The Parameter Number and name
     The Flight Number
     The mean of all the data plotted on the graph in HEX & DECIMAL

Typing 'H' at any time stops the plot and returns you to the DRS: prompt.

RECORDING COMMANDS

DATA - Start sending Data to HORACE

If it is the first time that DATA has been issued for the flight, you are
given the opportunity to correct the time before recording commences. 
"DATA ON" will appear at the top of the screen to indicate data is being sent
to HORACE.  While in this mode the keyboard will be slower to respond to your
input.

HOLD - Suspend Sending Data To HORACE

This stops sending data to HORACE (thus stopping any data from being
recorded). "DATA OFF" will appear at the top of the screen.

To resume recording 'DATA' must be entered again.

KILL - Closes down the system completely

This is a software RESET.  If you wish to continue using the DRS, the
initialisation procedure must be carried out again.

WIPE - Clears the screen and puts the DRS: prompt at the top of the screen.

TIME - Change the GMT (this can only be done if DATA has not yet been issued).

DATA DISPLAY COMMANDS

DUMP - Display data in numerical form.

The para data is displayed in numerical form 8 data values per line (except
paras 501-506 which are displayed 5 to a line).  The para number is displayed
at the bottom of the screen.

You are asked for the para number and then given a chance to change the select
rate.

You are then asked whether the data should be displayed in HEX or DEC.  The
display will continue until an 'H' is typed.

BITS - Binary display of the 12 bits in a data word.

This displays a given parameter in a form which shows how each bit of the data
is changing.

The display is in 2 colours:

     GREEN indicates the bit is a ZERO in that data word
     RED indicates the bit is a ONE.

The display is continuous, clearing the screen when it is necessary.  You are
asked Para Number and given a chance to change the select rate.  The MSB is
bit 11 in this display.  Typing 'H' at any time stops the display and returns
to the DRS: prompt.  The X axis is marked with the number of seconds from the
start of the plot and is annotated with GMT at start of the plot, para number
and name and flight no.

PLOT - Continuous plot of 1 parameter.

This plots 1 parameter against time on an X/Y graph and will clear the screen
automatically when the screen is full.

You are asked for Para Number and then given a chance to change the select
rate.  Typing 'H' at any time stops the plot and returns you to the DRS:
prompt.  See NOTES ON PLOTTING for details of the graph.
                               
GRAF - Plots a screen full of 1 parameter then waits for a prompt.

This plots 1 parameter against time but when it has filled the screen it waits
for you to tell it to clear the screen and continue the plotting.  You are
asked for Para Number and given a chance to change the select rate.  Pressing
the SPACE bar continues the plot.  Typing 'H' stops the plot and returns you
to the DRS: prompt.  See NOTES ON PLOTTING for the details of the graph.

TWOP - Continuously plots 2 parameters on the same graph.

This plots 2 parameters (one in GREEN the other in RED) against time and will
clear the screen automatically when the screen is full.  You are asked for
Para Number and select rate required for both Paras.  The select rate chosen
for the graph will be the smaller of the two requested.  Pressing the SPACE
bar continues the plot.  Typing 'H' stops the plot and returns you to the
DRS: prompt. 

CHEK - Carry out plots on a list of parameters one at a time.

You are asked which parameter in the list to start from.  The parameters are
listed on the Flight Leaders' pre/in-flight Check List log.

A plot is given of each parameter in turn, you are told which parameter is to
be plotted and are given the opportunity to change the sample rate.  The plot
will stop after each screen full and wait for your instruction.  You may give
your instruction at any time during the plot, not only when the screen is
full.

The instructions which are available are:

     A SPACE will continue with another screen full of the same parameter
     
     Typing '1' will go on to the next parameter in the list

     Typing '-' will go back to the previous parameter
     
     Typing 'H' wll bring you back to the DRS: prompt

See NOTES ON PLOTTING for the details of the graphs plotted.

BCDS - Carry out a dump on a list of parameters one at a time.

You are asked which parameter to start from in the list (again the parameters
are listed on the Flight Leaders' pre/in-flight Check List log).  The data is
displayed in DUMP form with some parameters in HEX others in DEC.  The
parameter number and name are displayed at the bottom of the screen.  

The display will continue until one of the following occurs:
     Typing '1' will go on to the next parameter in the list

     Typing '-' will go back to the previous parameter

     Typing 'H' will bring you back to the DRS: prompt.
                               
MCR6 - Display the same slot for each of the 6 MCR parameters.
You are asked which slot to select (1 to 5).
The display consists of 6 numbers across the screen for each second:  
The first 4 are in DECIMAL as these are the data channels (501-504)
The last 2 are in HEX as these are the housekeeping channels (505-506).
Typing 'H' stops the display and returns you to the DRS: prompt.

HELP

Displays a list of currently available DRS programs and a brief description of
each.

Appendix A                SIMON reset button

SIMON (the serial data interface box) has been furnished with a reset button.
It can be found on the side of SIMON next to the RV monitor. Thus if there is a
problem that causes a loss of serial data the SIMON interface can be reset
without having to reset the DRS (which was the case in the past) and without
the loss of data that this would involve.

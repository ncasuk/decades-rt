                                                                30 August 1989
                        NAVAID OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

1.   Switch on the TELETYPE (H157) and place ON LINE.  (On the aircraft the
     power will not actually be applied until the NAVAID CIRCUIT BREAKER is
     made, but the TELETYPE must be in the 'ON' condition to print out the
     intial message when the NAVAID CONTROLLER PROGRAM is started.)
2.   Make NAVAID CIRCUIT BREAKER on JB11A and switch on:-
     a.   OSCILLATOR/PSU (H142)
     b.   OSCILLOSCOPE (H143)
          Set all controls to position marked with red.
     c.   TAPE FORMATTER (H472)
     d.   TAPE RECORDER (H471)
          Ensure tape with write ring fitted is loaded into TAPE RECORDER.  To
          load a tape reel, position the reel over the quick release hub and
          depress the centre plunger.  This allows the reel to slip over the
          rubber ring on the hub.  Press the reel evenly and firmly against
          the back flange of the hub with the centre plunger depressed. 
          Release the centre plunger.  The reel is now properly aligned in the
          tape path and ready for tape threading.  Thread the tape as
          indicated on the tape panel.  Lay about three inches of tape onto
          the take-up reel and manually tension the tape by rotating the
          supply hub.  Depress the release LOAD switch.  This brings the tape
          and tape tension arms to the correct position.  Depress the release
          LOAD switch a second time.  When the BOT mark reaches the load
          point, the tape stops and the drive is now ready.  Close the dust
          cover door and safety door inserting the two retaining pins.  (This
          must always be closed during take off and landing.)
          Switch ON LINE on the TAPE RECORDER  and press the RESET button on
          the TAPE FORMATTER.
     e.   TELEMETRY RECEIVERS (five), (H146, H147, H149, H150, H151).
     f.   SIGNAL SWITCHING UNIT (H473).
          Set switches to CHAIN 1, MASTER and LOCAL.

     Meanwhile teletype has printed:-

          MET O 15 DROPSONDE SYSTEM VERSION 1.20 26/11/87 
          ENTER DATE (FORMAT - DD/MM/YY)

3.   Enter date followed by <CR>

     Teletype prints:-

          ENTER TIME (FORMAT - HH:MM:SS)

4.   Enter time followed by <CR>
     Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) on the SSU is activated.

     Teletype prints:-

          HH:MM:SS TAPE - BEGINNING OF TAPE



                                   -3-  


                                                                APPENDIX 32
                                                                30 August 1989
5.   If not appropriate the teletype will now print out a list of the devices
     which are not connected or inoperative eg.

          COMPARATOR 14 NOT PRESENT
          REAL TIME PROCESSOR NOT PRESENT

6.   The teletype will now print:-
     
          DEFAULT SL3/FRENCH OK? (Y OR N)

     If SL3 and FRENCH are the Loran chains required, then type `Y' <CR> and
     proceed to Para 8.  This automatically selects options 8 and 10 for the
     two chains.  Available options are listed in Annex A.

7.   Selection of option for Chain 1 is now invited followed by the question
     MODIFY? (Y OR N).  If the answer is `Y' then the operator may modify
     search windows, time constants, initial SNR or threshold values for each
     station.

     The above process is repeated for Chain 2.

8.   The teletype will no print:-

          ENTER TAPE HEADER - MAX 25 CHARS

     Here the operator should typically enter the flight number and Area or
     Project, bearing in mind the 25 character limit.  It is not necessary to
     indicate the chain configuration in use as this is automatically inserted
     into the tape header along with date and time.
     Hit <CR>.

     At this point the tape should move indicating that the header has been
     written and the trigger lights on the NAVAID CONTROLLER should be
     simultaneously illuminated for all 12 comparators.  Trigger pulses should
     also be applied to the OSCILLOSCOPE whereupon a display should be
     observed.

     Teletype prints:-

          HH:MM:SS SINGLE KEY COMMAND MODE

     The OSCILLATOR should now be allowed to warm up for at least 30 minutes
     before proceeding further.  Signals on the OSCILLOSCOPE can be examined
     in conjunction with the switches on the SSU to establish if the
     OSCILLATOR drift is acceptable.  (<1 microsecond/second.)








                                   -4-


                                                                APPENDIX 32
                                                                30 August 1989

9.   When the OSCILLATOR drift is acceptable, select CHAIN 1, MASTER and LOCAL
     on the SSU and use the following keys to position the `MASTER' within the
     search window and achieve `LOCK'.

          1 - Move station left 10  milliseconds.
          2 - Move station left   1 millisecond.
          3 - Move station left 100 microseconds.
          7 - Change phase code.
          9 - Initiate LOCK sequence.

     The `MASTER' should be identified on the OSCILLOSCOPE and moved using
     keys `1', `2' and `3' to the left hand edge of the display, reducing the
     time base setting as appropriate until the individual cycles of 100 kHz
     in the first pulse of the group of eight, can be discerned.  If the
     staiton is moved too far such that the first pulse or pulses disappear
     off the left edge of the screen, then the procedure above should be
     repeated.

     The phase coding of the signal should now be checked using key `7'.  The
     correct phase is indicated by a `clean' sine wave signal.  At this point
     key `9' should be pressed to initiate the lock on sequence.  When the
     `MASTER' has locked on correctly the teletype prints:-

          HH:MM:SS  LOCAL LOCK ON CHAIN 1

     Note that only the `MASTER' has locked on at this stage.  The `SLAVES'
     will follow suit eventually dependent on width of search windows and
     signal strengths.  It is possible that a slave may never achieve a
     workable signal strength, in which case it should not be used for
     wind-finding purposes.  LORAN data dumps to tape should now be occurring
     every 10 seconds and the LCD should show the SNR's of all stations on
     Chain 1 for all six channels.

10.  Select CHAIN 2 on SSU  and repeat Para 9.
11.  After the teletype has printed:-

          HH:MM:SS LOCAL LOCK ON CHAIN 2.

     It will follow this with a list of up to six stations which were selected
     in Para 6 or 7 followed by:-
          SELECT ORDER FOR WINDFINDING

          MASTER: (here enter number for master)
          SLAVE A: (here enter number for Slave A)
          SLAVE B: (here enter number for Slave B)

     At present only three stations may be used for real-time wind-finding,
     therefore the three selected should reflect the best geometry with regard
     to the area in which the sondes are to be dropped.  Note also that the
     MASTER, SLAVE A and SLAVE B can be any of the stations listed and not
     necessarily in the same chain or order.  The selection can be changed
     later if required by use of the ORDER command.  See Para 26.
                                   -5-


                                                                APPENDIX 32
                                                                30 August 1989

12.  At this stage, by use of the SSU, LCD and OSCILLOSCOPE each station
     should be checked to see that reasonable SNR's are achieved when tracking
     is occurring at the third or fourth negative going zero crossing of the
     loran pulse.  If adjustments are required then the following keys should
     be used:-

     `;' - Move tracking point one cycle left.

     `:' - Move tracking point one cycle right.

     The keys will only operate in SINGLE KEY COMMAND MODE on the station
     being viewed on the OSCILLOSCOPE.  It may be necessary on weak signals to
     move the tracking point further into the pulse in order to achieve an
     acceptable SNR.  The minimum acceptable SNR is -7 or -8 db.

13.  At this time the system is in the SINGLE KEY COMMAND MODE and only keys
     1-9, `;', `:', and `X' are operational.  To revert to normal mode press
     `X' whereupon the teletype should respond with:-

          HH:MM:SS NORMAL KEY COMMAND MODE

     In this mode the tracking point of the displayed station can not be
     accidentally changed.  Single key mode may be re-entered by typing KEY
     <CR>.  See para 26.

14.  When the operator is satisfied that all stations are tracking
     satisfactorily then a print-out of TIMES OF ARRIVAL (TOA), TIME
     DIFFERENCES (TD), SNR and CROSS CHAIN TIME DIFFERENCES (CTD) may be
     obtained by entering the commands (in normal mode):-

          TOA <CR> - prints out times of arrival in microseconds for 12
          comparators.
          TD <CR>  - prints out time differences in microseconds for 12
          comparators.
          SNR <CR> - prints out SNR's in dbs for each station on 12
          comparators (-13 db = no signal).
          CTD <CR> - prints out the cross chain time differences between chain
          `masters' in microseconds.

     The latter print-out is desirable if accurate aircraft positions are
     required using the cross chain facility.  It should be carried out at the
     start (before take-off), during and at the end of the flight (after
     landing) at known positions.

     Times are printed out preceding each line of data.

     If TOA, TD or SNR is required for just one channel only then the command
     should be followed by a letter designating the channel.

     eg.  TOAL will print out the TOA's for the LOCAL channel on both chains.
          TDE will print out the TD's for SONDE E channel on both chains.

                                        -6-


                                                                APPENDIX 32
                                                                30 August 1989

15.  There are at present 21 other commands which may be used in the NORMAL
     COMMAND MODE, mainly associated with the launching of sondes and the
     printing/plotting of realtime data.  These are summarised in paras 16-26.

16.  LAUNCH <CR>

     Teletype prints:-

          ENTER LAUNCH POSITION

     Here the operator enters position previously obtained from the Navigator. 
     The format should be as in 51 29 N 00 45 W paying attention to the
     correct spacing.  If the format is incorrect the position request will be
     repeated.

     Teletype prints:-

          ENTER SONDE NUMBER - FORMAT XNNN

     If the frequency letter is not A-E or the number is <1 or> 127 then the
     message `INVALID NUMBER' will be printed.  If the frequency letter
     entered is already in use then the message `*THIS FREQUENCY IS NOT
     CLEAR*' will be printed.  Otherwise the teletype prints:-

          SONDE XNNN IS READY.  CORRECT? Y/N

     If the answer is anything other than `Y' the teletype will print:-

          NO SONDE READY FOR LAUNCH

     Otherwise teletype prints:-

          READY

     This indicates that the sonde is ready for launch.

     If at this stage it is required to terminate the launch, then the command
     ABORT <CR> should be typed, whereupon the teletype prints:-

          *LAUNCH ABORTED*

     Note that other commands including CLEAR may be entered whilst in the
     launch READY condition.

17.  When the sonde is ejected the MANUAL LAUNCH BUTTON is pressed and the
     following actions take place:- 

     a.   The LOCAL TOA's + RECEIVER DELAY (usually 40 microseconds) are
          passed to the relevant pair of comparators for the frequency of
          sonde ejected.
     b.   The LOCAL label on the LCD of the sonde channel changes to a time in
          seconds from launch updated every second.
                                        -7-


                                                                APPENDIX 32
                                                                30 August 1989
     c.   The relevant sonde channel indicator light on the SSU changes from
          green (local) to amber (sonde launched).
     d.   The remote TTL LORAN signal from the appropriate UHF RECEIVER is
          switched through to the corresponding comparator on each chain in
          place of the LOCAL signal.
     e.   The appropriate MET CARD will be activated.
     f.   The teletype will print:-

          HH:MM:SS SONCE XNNN LAUNCHED
     g.   After about 4-8 seconds the met signals should synchronise and the
          letters SM should appear after the time on the LCD for the
          appropriate sonde channel.
     h.   The SNR's on the LCD for the appropriate frequency should be reading
          reasonable values indicating that sonde loran lock has been
          achieved.

18.  At this stage the sonde signals should be checked for adequate SNR's and
     correct tracking point.  If necessary the tracking points should be
     adjusted, but only if it is deemed essential for good wind measurement. 
     Met signals may be checked on the OSCILLOSCOPE using the appropriate MET
     switch on the SSU.

19.  Real time met data from the sonde may be obtained in a variety of ways as
     detailed below.  The first three commands require that the COLOR PLOTTER
     be operational.  See Annex C for full COLOR PLOTTER instructions.

20.  TEFI <CR>

     If the REAL TIME SYSTEM is not connected the teletype will print:-

          REAL TIME NOT AVAILABLE

     Otherwise the teletype will print:-

          ENTER SONDE NUMBER - FORMAT XNNN

     If the number or format is incorrect then the teletype prints:-

          INVALID NUMBER

     and repeats request for sonde number.

     The REAL TIME SYSTEM may now respond with one of the following six
     messages if appropriate:-

          SONDE NOT IN STORE
          NO PLOTTER
          SONDE NOT IN STORE - NO PLOTTER
          PLOTTER BUSY
          NO RESPONSE FROM REAL TIME
          *ERROR* BYTE RECEIVED xxx

     
                                        -8-


                                                                APPENDIX 32
                                                                30 August 1989
     Otherwise the plotter will commence drawing an abbreviated tephigram at
     ten second intervals, with the isopleths excluded, to be used with an
     overlay.  This command is used where speed of plot is essential.  Also
     the pressure, equivalent potential temperature, temperature and winds are
     tabulated every 30 seconds.  This continues until the end of the stored
     data is reached, the sonde is CLEARED or the plot is ABORTED by the NOMET
     command.  See para 24.  This command may be used in real-time or at any
     time after the event since the data is held in a battery backed store.

21.  TEPHI <CR>

     This command is similar to TEFI except that a tephigram complete with
     isopleths is plotted at ten second intervals.  Time, pressure,
     temperature, winds and a wind vector are tabulated alongside the tephi at
     30 second intervals.

22.  PRINTMET <CR>

     The met data is tabulated at 10 second intervals giving time, pressure,
     temperature, ept, humidity and winds.

23   TTMET <CR>

     This command is the same as PRINTMET except that the data is printed out
     on the TELETYPE rather than the plotter.  This facility is used for a
     quick look at the met data and if the PLOTTER is not available.  It also
     provides a convenient data summary after sonde dropping is complete.  It
     is the fastest method of retrieving sonde data.
     If the teletype is printing out met data and it is required for NORMAL
     command or SINGLE KEY command mode then the ESC key should be pressed. 
     When ESC has been recognised by the system the message:-

          PAUSE - TTMET MODE

     will appear, allowing the operator full use of the keyboard.
     If no further met data is required then NOMET <CR> should be entered. 
     Upon receipt of this command one or two further lines of data are printed
     out, followed by the word ABORTED.  the TELETYPE is now in the NORMAL
     COMMAND MODE.
     If however it is required to continue printing met data on the TELETYPE
     then the command CONT <CR> should be entered upon which the TELETYPE will
     carry on from the point reached when the ESC key was pressed.
     The printout will continue until the end of store is reached or the ESC
     key is again pressed.

24.  NOMET <CR>

     Typing this command causes any printing or plotting on the COLOR PLOTTER
     to be curtailed as soon as the plotter buffer has emptied.  The word
     ABORTED will appear at the bottom right of the plotter paper.
     For use in TTMET see para 23 above.

                                                                30 August 1989
25.  CLEAR <CR>

     This command is used when a sonde has reached the end of its descent
     and/or met/loran signals have ceased for any reason.  This would occur at
     around 12 minutes for a drop from 26,000ft.

     Teletype prints:-

          WHICH FREQUENCY?

     If the frequency entered is not in use the teletype will print:-

          *THIS FREQUENCY IS ALREADY CLEAR*

     If the frequency entered is still producing good met data as evidenced by
     the letters SM on the LCD then the operator will be warned and given the
     option of still clearing the frequency or exiting the command with no
     action.  Otherwise the following actions take place:-

     a.   The LOCAL LORAN signals will be switched on to the SONDE comparator
          pair in place of the REMOTE signals from the UHF receiver.
     b.   The LOCAL TOA's will be passed to the SONDE comparator pair.
     c.   The relevant sonde indicator light on the SSU will change from amber
          to green (SONDE to LOCAL).
     d.   The space occupied by the sonde elapsed time on the LCD will revert
          to LOCAL.
     e.   The SNR's for that sonde channel will now be registering LOCAL
          SNR's.
     f.   The relevant MET CARD will now revert to its standby state.
     g.   The teletype will print:-

          HH:MM:SS FREQUENCY X CLEARED

26.  Other commands available are:-

     ORDER <CR>      Enables the re-selection of the station order for
                     wind-finding.  This command should not be implemented
                     whilst any sonde is in the air.
     SETPOS <CR>     Enables entry of sonde drop position if original position
                     entered in LAUNCH procedure is no longer valid.
     NOTAPE <CR>     Will disable data dumpts to tape without affecting the
                     rest of the program.
     TAPE <CR>       Restores data dumps to tape.
     ENDTAPE <CR>    This places two EOF marks on the tape and rewinds,
                     prompting for a new tape.  Data dumps continue when new
                     tape is placed on line.  Data is lost during changeover
                     period, hence this command should only be carried out
                     when no sonde dropping is occurring.
     TIME <CR>       Prints out time of day on teletype in format HH:MM:SS
     DROP <CR>       Prints out drop times in seconds for each sonde.
     FREQ <CR>       Prints out frequencies in use.

                                                                30 August 1989

     KEY <CR>        Puts system into SINGLE KEY COMMAND MODE in order to make
                     adjustments to the tracking point of the displayed
                     station on the OSCILLOSCOPE.  Key `;' will move tracking
                     point one cycle towards the front of the pulse, whereas
                     key `:' will move the tracking point one cycle to the
                     right.  When used after LOCAL LOCK has been achieved then
                     the teletype responds with:-

          HH:MM:SS COMP XX - CYCLE or
          HH:MM:SS COMP XX + CYCLE

     This information is required if accurate aircraft position is to be
     computed on COSMOS.

     FLAGS <CR>      Prints out the current status of each station ie. whether
                     or not the SNR is above threshold.
     MEMORY <CR>     This command is a diagnostic tool and should not normally
                     be used in flight.  See Annex B for full description.
     ENDFLT <CR>     This command should be used at the end of the flight,
                     after landing but before power changeoever.  The
                     following actions take place.

     a.   Teletype prints:-

          HH:MM:SS FLIGHT ENDED - NNN BLOCKS WRITTEN TO TAPE
          HH:MM:SS TAPE - FILE MARK WRITTEN
          HH:MM:SS TAPE - FILE MARK WRITTEN
     b.   Two EOF marks are written to tape
     c.   A terminate command is sent to all comparators to restart their
          programs.
     d.   The NAVAID CONTROLLER program restarts with the usual message.
          Note.  The system would normally be switched off at this stage,
          before power changeover occurs.

     RESTART <CR>    This command should be used when it is necessary to
                     relock the system due to malfunction, weak signals or a
                     new chain configuration is required.  It operates in the
                     same manner as ENDFLT but only writes one EOF mark to
                     tape.

27.  If a command is entered which is not recognised by the system the
     teletype will print:-

          *WOT!*

     whereupon the correct command should be entered.

28.  If the tape  reaches the END OF TAPE mark, it will automatically perform
     an ENDTAPE operation as in para 26.

29.  A summary of available commands appears in Annex D.

has nine pulses.  When using a SLAVE as the `Master', care should be taken
that the correct slave is being used.  The figures in brackets below the
slaves indicate in milliseconds the delay between MASTER and SLAVE.
Pulse 8 chains do not identify a MASTER and even more care must be taken.  In
practice the stations may be identified by their relative signal strengths and
distances.

                                MEMORY COMMAND

     This command is a diagnostic tool which enables the operator to change
     any variable on any of the 12 comparator cards.  It should not normally
     be used in flight as it is possible to cause a program crash if used
     incorrectly.  Eventually it is hoped that this facility will be extended
     to include the MET cards and the REAL TIME SYSTEM.

1.   Type MEMORY <CR>

     The teletype responds with:-

          DEVICE? 6-17

2.   Here the operator enters the device number.  (Comparators are numbered
     from six to seventeen).  If the device number entered is outside this
     range then the teletype prints:-

          INVALID DEVICE NUMBER

     otherwise it prints:-

          VARIABLE ?

3.   The operator now enters the variable name exactly as in the attached
     list.  If the name entered is not recognised then the teletype prints:-

          WRONG NAME

     and invites a new device number.

     Otherwise the teletype will print out the variable contents in the form
     appropriate for its type.

4.   If the operator requires a further look at the same variable then the
     <LF> (Line Feed) key should be pressed.

5.   If it is required to change the variable the `/' key should be pressed
     followed by the new variable quantity and <CR>.

6.   Pressing <CR> will terminate the access to that variable and again invite
     a new device number.

7.   Pressing `Q' will exit the MEMORY command and return to NORMAL COMMAND
     MODE.

8.   The MEMORY command can be put to good use if adjustment of the 40MHz
     oscillator is required.
     By accessing DEVICE 6 and WEL_WORD[1] when locked up on CHAIN 1 and 2,
     the oscillator can be adjusted whilst repeatedly operating the <LF> key

     until the value is around zero, indicating near zero drift.  This should
     only be attempted after the OSCILLATOR has been switched on for at least
     an hour.  In effect the OSCILLATOR is being adjusted against the STANDARD
     of the LORAN station.  Obviously this should only be used when the
     aircraft is stationary.

                           COLOR PLOTTER OPERATION

WARNING
THE PEN CARRIAGE SHOULD NOT BE MOVED BY HAND WHEN THE POWER IS APPLIED. 
ALWAYS SWITCH OFF THE INSTRUMENT BEFORE PLACEMENT OF PENS.

1.   As used with the REAL TIME SYSTEM of the MET O 15 DROPSONDE SYSTEM, the
     COLOR PLOTTER is able to operate in three modes.

     a)   Print out temperature, equivalent potential temperature, humidity,
          pressure and winds from a sonde every 10 seconds.  (PRINTMET)
     b)   Plot out an abbreviated tephigram without isopleths to be used with
          a transparent overlay.  Points are plotted every 10 seconds with
          pressure, ept and winds tabulated alongside every 30 seconds. (TEFI)
     c)   As b) but with isopleths.  (TEPHI)

     All can be used in REAL TIME or after the event as data is held in
     battery backed RAM.  Where speed is required then TEFI is preferred.

2.   The instrument is configured to accept data on an RS232 interface at 1200
     bauds, from the REAL TIME SYSTEM in the SIGNAL SWITCHING UNIT.

3.   Before switching on the instrument, place pens in positions 3, 5 and 7 of
     the pen carriage.  The colors are not important but obviously black is
     better for photo-copying.  If necessary move the pen carriage gently by
     hand to one side or the other to move the pen lever.

4.   Ensure that the 25 way Cannon D connector and the mains connector are
     securely fitted to the rear of the instrument.

5.   Lift the PAPER HOLDING LEVER at the front left of the instrument and
     ensure that the PAPER CLAMP ROLLER is moved to the right hand position
     for A4 paper and to the left position for ANSI A paper.  (Av will be the
     usual case.)

6.   Place the paper on the PLATEN and align the paper top with the PAPER
     SETTING GUIDE PINS and the edges with the appropriate marks on the
     PLATEN.  Ensure that the paper lies flat against the PLATEN and no
     wrinkles or bulges are present.  Lower the PAPER HOLDING LEVER and the
     paper is now held in positon.

7.   Make the RADRAC circuit breaker on the JB (Starboard side) and switch on
     the plotter (left rear).  The PEN CARRIAGE will move first to the right
     and then to the left.

8.   Operation may be checked by manipulation of the position keys on the
     control panel.  Return to the top left hand corner of the paper.

9.   Hold down the SHIFT and RESET keys simultaneously.  This is equivalent to
     a software initialise instruction.  All plotter conditions are set to
     default values and the plotter buffer is cleared.

                                                                30 August 1989

10.  The instrument is now ready to PRINT or PLOT data from the REAL TIME
     SYSTEM.

11.  When the NAVAID operator enters the commands PRINTMET, TEFI or TEPHI and
     the appropriate sonde number, the plotter will commence to print or plot
     the data.  Operation will be terminated either by reaching the END OF
     STORE or by the operator aborting with the command NOMET or CLEAR.  When
     the words ABORTED or END OF STORE are printed out on the bottom right of
     the paper, the PLOTTER OPERATOR may lift the PAPER HOLDING LEVER and
     remove the paper from the rear of the instrument.

12.  The PLOTTER OPERATOR should now if necessary place another piece of paper
     in the instrument as outlined in para 6 above and press SHIFT and RESET
     together to re-initialise.  The NAVAID OPERATOR should now be informed
     that the PLOTTER IS READY.

13.  If for any reason it is necessary to switch off the instrument, this is
     perfectly acceptable, even in the middle of a plot, as long as the NAVAID
     OPERATOR is informed.  He will then type the command NOMET and the
     instrument can be switched on again after the operator has rectified the
     problem, inserted paper etc.
     Possible reasons are - paper jamming or slipping - pen running dry.
     The NAVAID OPERATOR may now restart the plot after the instrument has
     been re-initialised.
     It is possible to PAUSE the plotter by pressing SHIFT and PAUSE together. 
     A possible use is to enable the operator to read the plot whilst the
     paper is stationary.  A further press of SHIFT and PAUSE will cause a
     resumption of plotting without loss of data.

14.  If the plotter should fail for any reason, then met data may be printed
     out on the TELETYPE.

15.  When the plotter is no longer required, it should be switched off on the
     machine and at the JB.  The pens should be removed, capped and stowed in
     a secure place together with the unused plotting paper.

<U><P>Description</P>
</U>
<P>The NAVSTAR XR5M Global Positioning System comprises the receiver, mounted in the aft core console behind the XR5M GPS antenna panel, and an active antenna mounted on the ridge antenna fairing aft of the wings.  Power is by 28V DC.  12V is fed to the antenna along the co-axial downlead. </P>

<P>The system is interrogated once a second by HORACE using an RS232 link, and the data is recorded by HORACE in separate GPSDAT files; no GPS data are recorded by the DRS.  HORACE also provides a real time display of all the GPS data being received, together with the facility to initialize the receiver with present position and time.</P>

<P>The system uses the coarse/acquisition codes transmitted by the GPS system of satellites to estimate the aircraft's position.  Normally the system uses up to eight of the satellites visible to the antenna to work out position and velocity; if there are less than four visible, for example because the aircraft's wings are masking some, then the system may not be able to compute position or do so with a reduced accuracy.</P>

<P>The system must be given an initial position to an accuracy of better than 100 miles.  It also needs accurate satellite position information which it down loads from the satellites over a period of time.  As a result it may take up to 15 minutes to work out its initial position, although normally it only takes a few minutes.</P>

<P>Horizontal measurement accuracy is within 100m for 95% of the time, and vertical position is accurate to about 150m for 95% of the time, when a full set of satellites are visible and selective availability is applied.</P>

<U><P>Possible problems</P>
</U>
<P>The following problems and possible solutions are based on the information available from the HORACE GPS data display option.</P>

<OL>

<U><LI>GPS time not updating every 2s</U> - HORACE asks for messages from the GPS receiver every second.  If it fails to receive any then the GPS receiver may be off or faulty, or there is a problem with the RS232 link between HORACE and the GPS receiver.</LI>

<U><LI>Maint/CDU item not 0200/1 or Recvr fault not 0</U> - There is likely to be a hardware fault with the GPS receiver.  Try turning it off for a minute and then on, using the GPS circuit breaker on the aft core console..</LI>

<U><LI>Trkrs/Dynam not 6/4, or Geo datum not 1, or Recvr ID not 0</U> - The receiver has not been set up correctly, or has lost its settings.  This is most likely if a new receiver is being used or the receiver has been in use in the lab.  These items can only be set correctly using a PC running the XR5 CDU program, or the dynamics can be set by running the XR5_DYNAMICS_SET program in the HORACE [.TEST] directory.  Note that the receiver will only work correctly in the air if its Dynamics are set to 4, although it will work with other values when on the ground.</LI>

<U><LI>Lat/Long not within 100 miles (1 deg say) of actual position</U> - This may be due to the aircraft moving more than 100 miles while the receiver has lost lock due to insufficient satellites or other reasons, or may be due to the receiver being switched on or initialised with the wrong values.  Note that when the receiver is switched on it uses the position with which it was last initialised, which may be far from the present position.  Whatever the reason, the GPS receiver will never lock on if it is using a position that is more than 100 miles out; the receiver should be re-initialised with the correct position.</LI>

<U><LI>GPS date and UTC time not the same as the current date and GMT</U> -  This is acceptable for a short time after switching on the receiver, but should soon correct itself once data are received from a satellite.  If not switch off, switch on, and re-initialize.</LI>

<U><LI>Carr/noi not in range 30 to 52 db-Hz for each satellite</U> - The main reason for low carrier to noise ratios is that the satellites are low on the horizon (large pseudo ranges) or being masked by parts of the aircraft.  The receiver will not lock onto new satellites when their carrier to noise ratios are low, although it may continue to use existing satellites.  This problem normally corrects itself as the aircraft and the satellites move.  If all the carrier to noise ratios are similarly low it may indicate a problem with the antenna, its amplifier, the downlead or the splitter box.</LI>

<U><LI>Nav degraded not 0, HEPE/VEPE &gt; 512, Coherent not 1</U> - These are normally indications of a poor satellite configuration, or less than four satellites being visible; this leads to incorrect or reduced accuracy data being computed, and the Nav Degraded bit is normally a fairly good indicator that something is less than perfect.  If the problem does not correct itself within five minutes, suggest you turn off GPS receiver, wait a minute, turn it on, and initialise it.</LI></OL>

<U><P>General notes</P>
</U>
<OL>

<LI>M24 should update every 2 secs;  M20 every 6 secs.  M31 and DOPs are not sampled at present.   M18 is no longer available.</LI>
<LI>SV stands for Space Vehicle, ie. satellite number.</LI></OL>


<U><P>M24 (message 24)</U>:</P>
<OL>

<LI>GPS time should be about 13 seconds ahead of GMT.</LI>
<LI>Note that lat, longs, heights etc may continue to change, incorrectly, even when there are insufficient satellites to make a measurement.</LI>
<LI>HEPE/VEPE - estimates of position error normally &lt;= 512. More is a problem.</LI>
<LI>E/N BS are distances east and north of the normal operating base.</LI>
<LI>'Diff cor' - differential correction should always be 0.</LI>
<LI>If the 'Coherent' bit is not set for a satellite, then it is not being tracked correctly; this may or may not be indicated by the 'Noncoher' bit being set.</LI>
<LI>If the 'Nav degraded' bit is set all positions and velocities are likely to be wrong and TARDIS will not use them.  Except when starting up or initialising, the setting of the 'Nav deg' bit is likely to indicate a problem.</LI>
<LI>If the 'Altitude held' bit is set, the height and vertical velocities are not being correctly updated, although they may still be changing.  This bit normally sets when there are insufficient satellites.</LI>
<LI>'Recvr fault' must be zero - a one indicates a hardware problem - see the maintenance word of message 20.</LI>
<LI>'Recvr ID' - Receiver ID - should be 0.</LI>
<LI>'Recvr type' must say XR5M - if not the XR3 software is being used by mistake.</LI>
<LI>Geo datum' must be 1 - indicates that the WGS-84 datum is being used.</LI></OL>

<U>
<P>M20 (message 20)</U>:</P>
<OL>

<LI>Carrier/noise normally about 25 to 53, and is typically low when the satellite is low and its pseudo range is high. </LI>
<LI>Tropospheric and ionospheric corrections should be non zero, typically a few 10s of metres.</LI>
<LI>IODE - Issue of Data Ephemeris - should be non-zero.  If it is zero, then probably it has no ephemeris.</LI>
<LI>Date is GPS date and should be correct.  Time is UTC (=GMT to within a second) and should be exact when just updated, give or take HORACE processing time.  UTC offset should be about 13, and is the difference between GPS and UTC times, caused by leap seconds in the UTC clock.</LI>
<LI>'Trkrs' - trackers - should be six, and 'Dynam' - dynamics - must be 4.  The system is likely to work with a dynamics of 3, except in turns, but it won't work properly with dynamics of 1 or 0 except on the ground.</LI>
<LI>The 'Old almanac' bit should be 0.  If it is set, then the receiver will take at least 12 minutes to acquire a new almanac and start trying to fix its position.</LI>
<LI>Week number should be non zero - it counts up from 6 Jan 1980.</LI>
<LI>Clock bias and drift typically a few 1000 Km, and a few 10s or 100s of m/s.  A large drift rate (all *****s) may indicate loss of control by the system, giving wrong velocities and positions, but undetected by the system.</LI>
<LI>Software version and receiver type should be 4.01 (at present) and 2.</LI>
<LI>Maintenance word must be 0000.  If not there is a hardware fault:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Bit 9 - Preamplifier fault - if set and is likely to indicate that the new active GPS antenna takes more current than a normal passive one would.</LI>
<LI>Bit 10 - EPROM Checksum fault.</LI>
<LI>Bit 11 - RAM Write / Read Test.</LI>
<LI>Bit 12 - Oscillator fault.</LI>
<LI>Bit 13 - Critical Memory - possible battery backup fail.</LI>
<LI>Bit 14 - Real Time Clock fault - possible clock battery fail.</LI></UL>

<LI>CDU should be 1 (link to HORACE is okay).</LI></OL>

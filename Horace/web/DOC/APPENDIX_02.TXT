Booting Up
a)   Boot up DRS
b)   Start DRS sending data to HORACE - type DATA
c)   MicroVax and Graphics Box do not need to be switched off for the
     changeover to Aircraft power, but will trip out with loss of 230V.
     With the mains switch set to ON, HORACE starts the BOOT UP procedure
     automatically, taking approx  4 minutes.

When all the jobs are successfully running via the batch queue,

1.  Recording onto hard disk will continue until HORACE is shutdown or loses
    power, or if DRS stops sending data. 
2.  The derived parameters will be calculated once every 3 secs, and will be
    available to the graphics displays from powerup, provided the DRS is
    sending data to HORACE.
3.  The status of HORACE processes can be checked, including the state of
    data files being written to Hard and Optical disk, by selecting 
    Option 11
    of the Flight Leader's menu.                                    
4.  All the HORACE displays will show the main SELECT menu.
5.  A Flight Leaders system menu is available for certain tasks by typing 99
    when the main SELECT menu A is displayed.
    The system menu is run as a sub-process, the display program is
    re-entered by selecting Option 5.
    

HORACE Flight Leader's System Menu
 1 - Exit to DCL
 2 - Shutdown HORACE
 3 - Reboot HORACE and start all processes
 4 - Restart a display program
 5 - Return to Flight Leader's Display program
 6 - Run DRS simulation program
 7 - Restart H_VIDEO program
 8 - Stop recording to disks
 9 - Start/restart recording to disks 
10 - Restart derivation program
11 - Show status of HORACE processes
12 - Check / Change NDU fixed positions
13 - Do post flight file transfer to optical disk
14 - Run instrument check program - takes 2s.
15 - Run parameter check program - takes 45s


If at any time during flight the Aircraft Scientist's display program hangs:-
1. Press the reset button on the top Graphics Box, it will clear the display.
2. Select Option 4 from the Flight Leader's menu.
3. Select Option 1 : Restart Aircraft Scientist's display.
NB As a last resort, Option 3 on the Flight Leader's menu could be used.
   This should only be used as a last resort as some data will not be
   recorded whilst HORACE is rebooting. (Approx 4 minutes.)

If at any time during flight the Flight Leaders display program hangs:-
1. Press the "RESET" button on the bottom Graphics Box.
2. Then, using either the Front Right or Rear Van Laptop, select "99" from
   the Main Menu. A limited version of the Flight Leader's System menu will
   be displayed.  Select Option 2 ie. Restart Flight Leader's Display program.  

VDU/PIX KEY
The Flight Leaders display has been set up differently to the other display
programs, enabling 3 lines of VDU mode to be displayed if required (mainly for
operator messages).  By toggling the VDU/PIX key the whole screen can be set
to VDU mode, and when returning to PIX mode the whole screen is refreshed into
graphics.

KEY ENTRY
Numeric Keys:  When a menu is displayed on the screen, a valid numeric key
entry can be pressed (followed by RETRN).
Alpha Keys:  At any time during displays or when menus are shown one of the
allowed alpha keys may be pressed, to go directly to the level of menu
required.  Selection from higher level menus will remain as previously
entered.  H for HELP is always available.

17. INSTRUMENTS
Displays DRS, GPS, INU, Satcom, Nephelometer OR Nevzorov data.

For the DRS, a separate menu is shown.  The options on this allow the DRS
parameters to be listed, displayed graphically, displayed in numerical dump
form (hex or decimal), or plotted in a binary bit pattern.

For the GPS there is the option of 1) displaying the current GPS parameters
and 2) initialising the GPS systems.

For the INU there is a separate menu with 3 options. 1) display the current 
data, 2) display the status page and 3) display one of the housekeeping pages 
or set the INU to Align or Navigate mode.

For Satcom, a separate menu is shown with 8 options.  These allow previously
sent and received messages to be viewed as well as housekeeping data and 
status pages.  There is also the option to compose and send a message.

For the Nephelometer a separate menu is shown.  This displays commands
which can be sent to the Nephelometer eg. perform a Zero Calibration,
Switch Backscatter mode off / on etc.

For the Nevzorov, a status page is shown listing raw and derived signals
for the LWC and TWC elements of the probe.
 

18. HORACE CCN DISPLAY  
CCN

data becomes available to HORACE it will be added to the plot or numeric dump
sequence unless disabled by the user.

1 Numeric dump giving all the temperatures, reference and detector values and
calculated supersaturations and CCN concentration.  Options C and D allow
stepping through the 5 most recent spectra.

A-SELECT  B-CCNMEN  C-PREV  D-NEXT  F-PRINT  G-VIDEO

plotted on individual axes and options appear for each one to be displayed in
turn.  If D selected the options appear thus:-
A-PLOT 1  B-SELECT  C-PLOT 3  D-PLOT 4  E-PLOT 5  F-PRINT  G-VIDEO  H-HORMAL

PLOT 2 has been selected and is being displayed. Pressing C will cause PLOT 3
to be plotted and the word SELECT will appear in the C box.  H selects the
previous option above.

Option C toggles between HOLD and UPDATE.
                                                                            
19. CHEMISTRY
Plots Chemistry (and other) parameters against each other or against height and
including time lags in one or both parameters if requested.

 
AFTER LANDING

1.   AFTER POWER CHANGEOVER

     a)   Type "HOLD" on DRS to stop recording.  Do a Post Flight Transfer of
          data onto a spare Optical Disk (Option 1 from FL menu).  
     b)   Shut HORACE down from the FL menu (Option 2).  When the 
          "System Shutdown Complete" message is displayed on the FR Laptop, 
          dismount the Optical disk 
     c)   Switch off Graphics Boxes and HORACE.
     d)   Power down the DRS and the Laptops.                                


                                                  
Notes on HORACE Disks

1. HORACE has 2 Hard Disks.  
     DKA0: - 4 Gbyte system hard disk (the logical name DUA0: is still valid)
     DKA100: - 9 GByte second hard disk
2. The CD Drive is labeled DQB0:
3. The Floppy Drive is labeled DVA0:

4. The Optical Disk drive is labeled DKA600   ("logical" name DUB0:)
   - Only use disks which are labelled "HORACE".
   - Flight data is recorded on Side A.  Side B is normally used to record
     ground calibration data.  If necessary, Side B can also be used to
     boot-up HORACE and for recording in the air.
   - The three optical disks used routinely for transferring data between
     HORACE and ICARUS each have a full copy of the system hard disk on their
     B side.  HORACE_05 normally has the latest copy of the system, while on 
     HORACE_01 and HORACE_03 it is normally a working system copy, but not 
     necessarily the latest.


Hard Disk Failure

In the event of a hard disk failure, or the need to restore the hard disk from
the optical disk, the system should first be booted off the optical disk, by
starting up HORACE with the optical disk loaded, The H_BACKUP procedure can 
then be called to restore the hard disk.  

Emergency Transfer to Optical Disk

If HORACE fails to transfer raw data to optical disk during flight for any
reason, ie it does not write to DRSDAT.DAT, GPSDAT.DAT or SAFIRE.DAT files 
onto optical disk, then the data can be retrieved after flight, using 
Option 13 of the Flight Leader's system menu.  This will identify the files 
associated with the flight on the hard disk, and transfer them to an optical 
disk.  Note that HORACE can store about 280 hours of flight data on hard disk. 

There are programs on HORACE which erase old data to free more space when it 
is required. These programs should not erase any data from a current flight,
only that from before several flights previously.

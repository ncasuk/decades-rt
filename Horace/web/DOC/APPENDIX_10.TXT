                     OPERATION OF THE E290 WEATHER RADAR
Pre Flight Checks
1.   Make 28V DC RADAR CB at JB3B.
2.   Make 200V AC RACK 2 INV CB at JB3B.
3.   Switch ON INVERTER - SW1 at Rack No 2.
4.   Switch ON RADAR TRANSFORMER at Rack No 2.
5.   Switch ON POWER & INDICATOR on Radar Programming Unit
6.   Set date on RPU, check display indicators by operating DATA/HOLD SWITCH
     (DATE, TIME, ELEVATION).
7.   Check camera operation by rotating the knob at the side of each unit. 
     Ensure the film advance claw is at its lowest position and fit two 16 mm
     film magazines, with film marked in the gate.
8.   Switch ON both switches below CAM 1 and CAM 2 meters.  Check RED lights
     and contents displayed.
9.   Operate Camera Test Switch and observe mechanisms.  Remove magazines to
     check film has advanced then refit.
10.  When complete switch OFF POWER & INDICATOR.  Stow spare magazines.

In Flight Operation
1.   Switch ON POWER & INDICATOR on RPU.
2.   Referring to Indicator Control Panel below display;
     a)   Set RANGE to STANDBY.
     b)   Set POWER ON - indicator illuminates.  After ~2 minutes.
     c)   Set RANGE as required - display operates.
     d)   Set WEA or CONTOUR.
     e)   Adjust MARK. BRILL to Max and CONTRAST for optimum.

To Obtain Control:  After Setting Up
1.   ENSURE UPPER AND LOWER ELEVATION SETTINGS ARE IN THE CORRECT RELATIONSHIP
     AND GREATER THAN 3o APART, RPU & DISPLAY ARE ON.
2.   set ELEVATION to SINGLE.
3.   Request the Flight Leader to obtain control from the Navigator.  The
     Captain or Navigator's Unit should be set to WEATHER before hand over.
4.   When control is acquired the TILT indicator will illuminate on the RPU. 
     The data display above screen will operate in time with scanner sweeps. 
     The RADAR will scan on the last elevation set before hand over.

Use of the RADAR
Elevation - With this switch set to Program the scanner will operate between
the limits set in 3o steps.  This mode can be used to locate weather or scan a
Frontal layer.
- With the switch set to SINGLE the unit will scan at a selected level.  This
mode can be used to observe echoes at set heights within cloud.

To select an elevation
a)   Set ELEVATION LIMITS switches to scan through a range of elevations
     including that desired
b)   Set switch to PROGRAM and observe display
c)   Set switch to SINGLE.  This should be done JUST BEFORE the desired  
     value appears, ie. if -3o is required select just after 0o when scanner
     is declining or just after -6o when inclining.  Otherwise the scanner may
     set to any random value.

                                                                  5 March 1985

Function - The MRF unit will display in either WEA or CONTOUR position.
In WEA the display shows all clouds containing large water droplets.

In CONTOUR the returns are processed to indicate relative turbulence within
clouds caused by varying precipitation rates.  Parts of the return signal
exceeding a pre-determined amplitude appear blank on the screen, therefore the
relationship between the overall size and blank portion shows the gradient of
turbulence.

The display is compensated such that, for the first 25 NM echoes from distant
ranges are amplified more than those from close range.  This means that a
given cloud will maintain its return as the aircraft nears it and the relative
intensity of near and far echoes are as they appear.  This feature does not
operate beyond ~25 NM.  The echo intensity decreases with increasing range.

Photography - When the RADAR has been set to the required mode and elevation
or scan (generally to avoid ground returns as Table 1) the display can be
photographed.  The cameras should be set to F4 and focussed to the appropriate
distance (during servicing).

Remove visor from screen, fit shade between magazines.  The front panel door
should be closed when photographing.

With two switches below meters ON the cameras are triggered by the scanner ~1
frame per second.  Therefore a fully loaded magazine will last ~2 hours, but
should be changed when it indicates about ¬ full.

The right magazine produces a correctly oriented image.

After Use

1.   Switch OFF both cameras

2.   Set ELEVATION to SINGLE at 0o

3.   Return control of the RADAR via the Flight Leader to the Aircrew.  Tilt
     extinguished when control taken.

4.   After control has been taken set RANGE to STANDBY and switch OFF display.

5.   Switch RADAR Program Unit - Indicator OFF
                               - Power OFF

6.   Switch OFF RADAR TRANSFORMER at Rack No 2
     IF PRT4 REQUIRED LEAVER INVERTER SW1 ON otherwise:

7.   Switch OFF INVERTER SW1 at Rack No 2

8.   Break 28V DC RADAR CB at JB3B

9.   Remove and annotate magazines, refit visor and camera cover.

Radar Attenuator
This unit is fitted above the RADAR controls on Rack 2 and is generally for
use on Met O 15 projects.  As of April 1984 the unit has not been calibrated
but is intended to provide attenuation in four automatic steps corresponding
to approximate precipitation rates of:

     0 = Max Signal/Min Attenuation = 0.5-1.0 mm/hr
     1                              =  2      mm/hr
     2                              =  8      mm/hr
     3 = Min Signal/Max Attenuation = 20      mm/hr

These values are displayed, on the unit digitally, also above the screen by
two lights.  There is also a B or Blank position which interrupts the video
signal between sweeps to erase the screen.

When the unit is switched on it will start from B and sequence as follows:

     B3B2B1B0BBB3B2B1B0BBB3 etc.

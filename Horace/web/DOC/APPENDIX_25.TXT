                          TOTAL WATER CONTENT METER

Circuit Breakers Required

1.   In the INS Bay 
          JB1        28 Volts DC  Lyman Alpha
          JB1        200 Volts AC Phases A, B, C Lyman Alpha.
2.   Front of Van
          JB4A       28 Volts DC TWC
 
Principles of Operation

Air is sampled isokinetically at approximately 7 litres per second.  The
sampled air passes through heater elements and stainless steel mesh screens
which raise its temperature to about 90°C.  Any water/ice particles are very
quickly evaporated.  The heated air passes a Lyman alpha hygrometer before
being exhausted from the instrument.  The hygrometer measures the water vapour
content of the sampled air.  A thermistor, placed at the hygrometer measures
the sample air temperature.  Because water vapour strongly absorbs hydrogen
Lyman alpha radiation, a source tube and an ionisation chamber detector
provide a very fast, sensitive measure of the total water content.

The probe is mounted in the PORT pico-pod position.  The POWER and INTERFACE
UNIT (PIU) is mounted on a shelf in the INS BAY to the PORT of the solarimeter
interface unit.

The CONTROL PANEL is situated in the front of the VAN.  Monitoring of the data
during flight or ground-check may be accomplished using the DRS.

Control Panel

a)   SOURCE CURRENT - This rotary switch selects the bias current applied to
     the source tube and can be thought of as the U.V. attenuator (larger
     currents produce stronger U.V. flux).  Normally this should remain at
     0.5mA.  Only if the detector voltage (parameter 70) nears full-scale
     (4095 bits) should this be increased.  There are 2 operational conditions
     under which this can occur.  Firstly, in extremely moist air (>20 g/kg -
     tropical) when very little U.V. reaches the detector due to strong
     absorption and secondly if the magnesium fluoride windows on the
     source/detector have degraded to such an extent that the U.V. flux is
     appreciably attenuated.  This degradation is a very slow process taking
     weeks or months to detect.

     Changing the SOURCE CURRENT can be an aid in assessing whether the probe
     is responding, since changing the current should cause a change in
     detector signal.  This action need not and should not be performed more
     than once per flight.

b)   SOURCE ON INDICATOR - is switched with the Source On switch which applies
     power to the source tube.  Power to the source tube is inhibited until
     the source tube hydride pellet is at a pre-determined temperature
     indicated by the SOURCE READY INDICATOR.

                                                               24 JANUARY 1989

c)   SOURCE READY INDICATOR - only lit when the source tube hydride pellet is 
     between two fixed temperatures.
                                                                 
d)   EVAP. HEATERS ONLY INDICATOR - indicates when Evap. Heaters switch is in
     up position - 2 Evap. Heaters ON.

e)   LYMAN ALPHA ON INDICATOR - when lit shows that power has been selected ON
     to the probe.

f)   EVAP. HEATERS ONLY SWITCH - when the switch is in the down position
     subject to the WEIGHT-OFF-WHEELS SWITCH, power is applied to 1 Evap.
     Heater only.
     
     If the switch is selected up, subject to the WEIGHT-OFF-WHEELS SWITCH
     power is applied to both Evap. Heaters and the lamp illuminates.

     Under normal conditions this switch should be UP - 2 heaters operative.

     The sample temp should be between 55 and 95C.  If >95C switch Evap.
     Heater 2 off ie. switch down.  If <55C switch Evap Heater 2 on - switch
     up.

g)   SOURCE ON SWITCH - may be switched on when the READY indicator (see (c)
     above) is lit.  This switch causes power to be applied to the source tube
     which results in U.V. emission.  This switch has no effect until the
     SOURCE READY INDICATOR is lit.

h)   LYMAN ALPHA ON SWITCH - controls the power, via relays, to the Power and
     Interface Unit and to the probe.

     In-flight, turning this switch on causes a relay to apply power to the
     evaporator heaters and to the nose cone heater.  To prevent possible
     damage on the ground, due to the lack of ventilation, this relay is
     inhibited by the WEIGHT-0FF-WHEELS-SWITCH associated with the MRF
     ANTICING BUS.  For this reason, before the ground checks, ensure that the
     ANTICING SWITCH has not been overridden by the key-switch on the MRF
     ANTICING PANEL, below the MAIN RELAY PANEL, forward of the VOSPER.

     When the LYMAN ALPHA is switched on, the Source tube heater should start
     to heat up.  The steady rise in temperature may be examined on the RTD or
     DRS displays.  Once the temperature has reached a pre-determined
     (hard-wired) temperature of 113oC in between 3 and 10 minutes, the READY
     INDICATOR should light.  This indicates that the SOURCE tube is ready and
     the SOURCE ON switch may be turned on.

i)   CONDITION INDICATOR - primarily draws the operators attention should any
     of the monitored parameters exceed pre-determined limits or that the data
     acquisition micro- has stopped.

     Turning the probe on with the LYMAN ALPHA ON switch applies power to the
     data acquisition system in the PIU.  The software in the microcomputer
     replies by flashing the CONDITION indicator ON/OFF 5 times.  This is only
     to inform the operator that the micro- has started correctly and has not
     'hung-up' for some reason.

     During normal operation this indicator should be OFF.  If it should 
     light, either the data acquisition micro- has stopped or data from one or
     more of the channels monitored by the data acquisition system have
     exceeded their normal envelope.  To facilitate the fault diagnosis a
     STATUS WORD is sent back to the DRS.  This STATUS WORD may be inspected
     on the DRS to pin down the cause of the problem.

     The STATUS WORD is a 12-bit number, the lowest 8 bits being related to a
     particular channel (bit 0 - parameter 70, bit 1 - parameter 71 etc.).  If
     the data from a particular channel has exceeded its normal envelope then
     the bit related to the channel in the STATUS WORD will not be set,
     ie. = 0.  Conversely, if the data is within the normal envelope the
     associated bit will be set, ie. =1.

j)   T.W. P.I.U. OVERHEAT LAMP - indicates the temperature in the T.W.
     electronics box is >80C.  Switch off at once and inform the Aircrew.

Pre-flight

Status Word & Fault Conditions

STATUS WORD

The STATUS WORD consists of a 12-bit word.  The LOWEST 8 bits relate to the 8
Lyman Alpha parameters received by SIMON.

Bit 0, the rightmost bit, relates to parameter 70, bit 1, relates to parameter
71 and so on.  Bits 8 to 12 have no meaning and will always be set (=1).

The normal state is all bits set (=1).  If any of the parameters stray beyond
a pre-defined envelope, defined in Appendix I, the related bit will NOT be set
(=0).

It must be assumed in the following paragraphs that the monitoring circuitry
in the PIU is operating correctly and that any fault is caused by the
parameter itself and not the monitoring circuitry.

ACTION REQUIRED IF THE CONDITION INDICATOR LIGHTS

CONDITION INDICATOR LIGHTS AND ALL THE BITS ARE SET (=1)

It is likely that the micro has hung-up.  Confirmation of this can be found by
looking at the LYMAN ALPHA parameters which will all show full-scale values
because SIMON will insert 4095 decimal into the DRS.
To restart the micro-, switch the probe OFF by breaking the LYMAN ALPHA ON
switch.  After about 2 seconds make the LYMAN ALPHA ON switch.  The micro-
should reply by flashing the CONDITION indicator ON/Off 5 times.  It will then
remain ON until the source tube has once again reached its operating
temperature and the detector signal falls below 4095 bits.  Once the READY
indicator has lit, the SOURCE TUBE should come on automatically if it is
already switched on.  The probe should now operate as normal and the CONDITION
indicator should go out.  If the micro- cannot be started, switch the system
OFF and note in the flight log.
Experience so far shows that the micro- has NEVER hung-up.

CONDITION INDICATOR LIGHTS AND ONE OR MORE BITS ARE NOT SET (-0)

Each parameter and associated STATUS WORD bit is now examined for likely
causes of a fault condition.
If the value returned by the PIU for any parameter strays beyond the envelope
defined in Appendix I, the associated bit will become unset (=0) and the
CONDITION indicator will light.

70 DETECTOR - bit 0

If the DETECTOR returns a value of 4095 decimal, bit 0 will be unset in the
STATUS WORD.  This indicates that too little or no U.V. is reaching the
detector.



                                       
                                     -5-


                                                                   APPENDIX 25
                                                               24 JANUARY 1989   

POSSIBLE CAUSES

1.   The source tube is switched OFF.
2.   There is a high water content being sampled.
3.   The source/detector windows have degraded.
4.   The source tube, detector tube or associated circuitry have failed.
ACTION

Check the position of the switches and the condition of the other parameters. 
If all appears normal, try increasing the SOURCE CURRENT in steps of 0.1 mA. 
This has the effect of increasing the U.V. flux from the source tube and the
detector should start to 'see' the increased flux.  Note down any change in
SOURCE current.
If there is no change in the DETECTOR signal when the SOURCE TUBE current is
at 1.0 mA, there must be some fault somewhere in the system and it should be
shut down.

71 NOSE TEMPERATURE - bit 1

This bit will be unset if the NOSE TEMPERATURE strays outside the defined
limits.
POSSIBLE CAUSES
1.   The NOSE heater is inhibited by the WEIGHT-OFF-WHEELS SWITCH, ie. the
     aircraft is on the ground.
2.   The heater has failed for some reason, for instance the thermal fuse has
     blown in the NOSECONE (120oC).
3.   The ambient air temperature is unusually cold or warm.
ACTION
ON THE GROUND
If the aircraft is on the ground and the NOSE TEMPERATURE is high (greater
than 30oC) and possibly rising, switch the probe off immediately and
investigate whether the ANTICE INHIBIT SWITCH has been overridden.  Allow at
least 20 minutes for the probe to cool before re-applying power, if there is
any doubt.
IN THE AIR
If the NOSE TEMPERATURE on the RTD display indicates a temperature less than
30oC but it is still fluctuating, it probably means that the ambient air
temperature is very cold and the controller to the nose heater cannot
compensate.  Under these conditions monitor the NOSE TEMPERATURE closely and
it should warm up when the outside air temperature rises.

If the indicated NOSE TEMPERATURE is greater than 90oC but less than 115oC it
is likely that the outside air temperature is very warm and the nose heater
controller cannot compensate.  Monitor this parameter closely and it should
cool down when the ambient air temperature falls.

If the indicated NOSE TEMPERATURE is greater than 115oC, switch the probe off. 
Check the outside air temperature.  If it is unusually warm, wait until it
cools down and then try switching the probe on in the usual manner.  Monitor
the NOSE TEMPERATURE closely for a while.

                                                               24 JANUARY 1989

72 SAMPLE TEMPERATURE - bit 2
This bit will be unset if the SAMPLE TEMPERATURE exceeds the envelope defined
in Appendix I.
POSSIBLE CAUSES
1.   On the ground, the EVAPORATOR HEATERS are inhibited by the
     WEIGHT-OFF-WHEELS switch.
2.   The aircraft is flying at an unusually high angle-of-attack.
3.   Both evaporator heaters have failed, ie. both their fuses have blown.
4.   The inlet port has become blocked or partially blocked by ice or foreign
     body.
ACTION
If the SAMPLE TEMPERATURE exceeds 115oC switch off EVAP. HEATER 2 if selected
otherwise switch the probe OFF since damage to the SOURCE/DETECTOR TUBES may
result.
If the aircraft is on the ground then normally the WEIGHT-OFF-WHEELS switch
inhibits the EVAPORATOR HEATERS which results in the SAMPLE TEMPERATURE being
at the outside ambient temperature.
If the cause of the problem is that the aircraft is flying at a high
angle-of-attack, associated with high SAMPLE TEMPERATURES, it is unusual for
this attitude to last for long periods during an experimental part of a
flight.  The probe may be switched on again once the manoeuvre has been
completed.  Monitor the SAMPLE TEMPERATURE closely for a while to be certain
the envelope for this parameter is not still exceeded.  If the SAMPLE
TEMPERATURE is less than 50oC switch the Evap. Heaters only switch to up - to
bring in the second heater as well.  Check Evaporator Currents.  If <0.1A
switch probe off.
If there is an obstruction to the inlet port then the EVAPORATOR CURRENTS will
fall to a low value of about 0.2-0.3 A.  Ice is unlikely to obstruct the inlet
port if the NOSECONE HEATER is functioning correctly and should be cleared
quickly.  Any substantial foreign body is unlikely to be cleared and the probe
should be switched off.
73 AMBIENT TEMPERATURE - bit 3
The AMBIENT TEMPERATURE sensor is used for diagnosis purposes.  It should not
be confused with the outside ambient temperature.  It consists of a thermistor
which may be placed anywhere inside the probe to monitor the temperature at
selected points.  No action need be taken if this bit is set except a note
made of its occurrence.
74 SOURCE TEMPERATURE - bit 4
This bit will be unset if the SOURCE TEMPERATURE exceeds the limits.
The SOURCE TEMPERATURE is a finely controlled parameter since large
fluctuations effect the U.V. flux from the source tube.  The temperature
normally fluctuates about a mean temperature ñ 0.1oC.  If the temperature
exceeds 120oC the supply to the SOURCE HEATER is inhibited electronically to
avoid damage to the heater.  At this point the SOURCE TEMPERATURE will fall
below 120oC and then start to rise again in a continuous cycle over about 5oC.
POSSIBLE CAUSES
1.   The SOURCE TUBE is being heated up from cold.
2.   The heater controller has malfunctioned.
3.   The TWC Meter has been switched off and then switched on again too soon.
     ie. <1 min.

                                                               24 JANUARY 1989

ACTION
If the source heater is being heated up from cold, no action is required.
If cause 3) applies.  Switch off for at least 1 min.
If the SOURCE TEMPERATURE continuously fluctuates beyond the envelope defined
in Appendix I it is likely that the heater controller has lost control and the
probe should be switched off.

75 and 76 EVAPORATOR CURRENTS - bits 5 and 6
The associated bit will be unset if the value returned by the PIU exceeds the
limits.  Bit 76 will be permanently set if Evap. Heater 2 is OFF.
With 2 Evaporators on the front heater (para 75) takes more current than the
second heater (Para 76) as the air reaching the second heater will have been
pre-heated.
POSSIBLE CAUSES
1.   One or both heaters have failed.
2.   Short-circuiting of the heater supply.
ACTION
ON THE GROUND
If the aircraft is on the ground and the EVAPORATOR CURRENTS are low (less
than 0.1 A), no action is required.
If the aircraft is on the ground and the EVAPORATOR CURRENTS are high (greater
than 0.1 A), switch the probe off immediately and investigate whether the
ANTICE INHIBIT SWITCH has been overridden.
IN THE AIR
Switch the probe off.

77 SOURCE CURRENT - bit 7
This bit will be unset if the value returned by the PIU exceeds the limits.
The currents are selected in discrete steps by the SOURCE CURRENT rotary
switch on the CONTROL PANEL.
POSSIBLE CAUSES
1.   The SOURCE is switched off
2.   Failure of the supply to the SOURCE TUBE
3.   SOURCE TUBE failure.
4.   Loss of control of the SOURCE CURRENT

ACTION
Check the position of the switches.
Monitor the SOURCE CURRENT and if it is greater than 1.0 mA switch the probe
off immediately.  If it is less than 0.4 mA try changing the selected current
on the CONTROL PANEL.  A delay of up to 10 seconds can occur before the
selected current becomes switched in, since the selector switch causes a LEDEX
switch in the PIU to search for the selected position.  A LEDEX switch only
operates in one direction so it may have to turn almost a complete revolution
before the selected position is found.
During this searching process the DETECTOR signal may swing wildly.  This is a
good sign, since it means that SOURCE and DETECTOR tubes have not failed.
If this attempt fails it should be assumed that the power supply or the SOURCE
TUBE have failed.  Shut the system down in the normal fashion.

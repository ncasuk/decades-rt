                  NITROGEN OXIDES ANALYSER (National Power)

Circuit Breakers Required

Forward Bulkhead:-   MRF Main Distribution Panel
                     a.  230V JB11 SUPPLY (two circuit breakers)
Rear Cargo Hold:-    JB11A
                     a.  3A fuse `NOx DETECTOR'
                     b.  `NOx PUMP' (CB)

Principles of Operation

The sample air is filtered then split into two streams: NO and NOx.  The NOx
stream passes through a converter which converts NO2 to NO.  Both streams then
pass through separate chambers where they are mixed with ozone.  This causes a
chemiluminescent reaction between the ozone and the NO concentration in the
air sample.  The wavelengths emitted (500-3000nm) are detected by two
photomultipliers, the light intensity emitted being proportional to the NO
concentration in the sample.  The NO2 concentration is electronically
calculated by subtracting the NO output from the NOx output.  Any one of these
three outputs can be output to the meter dial if selected by the option
switch.

Pre-Flight

1.   Turn POWER and PUMP ON, leave for HALF-AN-HOUR to dry out.
     DO NOT PUT OZONE ON AT THIS STAGE.
2.   DO NOT adjust SPAN settings.
3.   Dessicant should be BLUE (pink when damp).
4.   Switch RANGE switch to 0.1 for normal operation.
5.   Turn OZONE ON.
6.   Switch MODE switch to NOx for normal operation.
7.   BEFORE TAKE-OFF switch OZONE OFF FIRST.
8.   Switch POWER and PUMP OFF.

In-Flight

1.   Switch POWER and PUMP ON.
2.   Switch OZONE ON.
3.   Switch OZONE OFF.
4.   Switch POWER and PUMP OFF.

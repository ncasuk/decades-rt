                                                            9th November 1988
                           Broad Band Radiometers
 
Principles of Operation
 
There are two sets of broad band radiometers fitted to the aircraft, one set
mounted on top and one set mounted on the underside of the fuselage. Both sets 
are made up of three radiometers. Shortwave fluxes are measured with an Eppley 
PSP pyranometer covered with a clear dome. Near infra-red fluxes are measured 
with the same type of pyranometer fitted with a red dome which filters out
frequencies shorter than 0.7µm. Longwave infrared fluxes are measured with an
MRF designed pyrgeometer fitted with a silicon dome. The silicon dome will only
transmit longwave infrared radiation.
 
Each radiometer has three parameters recorded on the DRS: its signal, zero and
temperature.
 
Pre-Flight
 
Outside Aircraft.
 
1. Clean BBR domes with lens tissue.
2. Check dessicants are blue in colour.
 
Inside Aircraft.
 
1. Make "UPPER BBRs" and "LOWER BBRs" breakers on JB4B.
   Check upper BBR breaker made on JB5.
2. Check BBR parameters:
  i,  Check that the BBR signal do not read 4095.
  ii, Check the zero signals are correct.
  iii,Check the BBR temperatures, when decoded, are similar to the ambient air
      temperature.
   If any of the parameters seem incorrect, try breaking and remaking the
circuit breakers. If, after this there still seems to be a problem then INFORM
INSTRUMENTS SECTION immediately.
 
In-Flight
 
1. Check BBR parameters frequently as in steps 2,i to iii above.
 
Post-Flight
 
1. Break BBR Circuit Breakers on JB4B.
2. Clean Lower domes if time alows.
3. Arrange for covers to be put over BBR domes.

                        NON DE-ICED TEMPERATURE SENSOR

Circuit Breakers Required

1.   Forward Bulkhead - MRF Main Distribution Panel.
                        230 V. JB 4B
2.   Recorder Van, rear compartment - Junction Box 4B 0.5A Fuse.

PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION

The Non de-iced temperature element is a platinum resistance thermometer.  The
resistance of the platinum wire within the element alters in relation to the
changes in the air temperature.  The signal output from the sensor enters an
interface board in MILLIE where it is converted into DRS units and split into
two parameters : 23 -  fine non-deiced temperature and 24 -  coarse non-deiced
temperature. A seperate output goes from to a DPM which displays the data as
the Indicated Air Temperature.

                              
PRE FLIGHT
1.   Check temperature probe clear and undamaged.
2.   Check all connections on the rear of I.A.T. display unit are secure.
3.   Check INT/EXT switch on rear of display is set to EXTERNAL.
4.   Check DRS power switch on DRS control panel is ON.
5.   Switch I.A.T. display unit power to ON.
6.   Check display is reading with reasonable agreement with the outside air
     temperature.

IN FLIGHT
1.   Regular monitoring of I.A.T. readings in conjunction with I.A.S. and
     altitude should be maintained and logged.
2.   True non-deiced air temperature can be obtained from HORACE where it is 
     displayed as HORACE parameters 523 & 524.

3.   True air temperature can also be obtained by cross reference of I.A.S.,
     I.A.T. and height to extract a correction from the T.A.T. correction book.

POST FLIGHT
1.   ON TAXY, switch I.A.T. display unit OFF.
2.   Check temperature probe is clean and undamaged.
3.   After low level flights the temperature elements should be sprayed with
     distilled water followed by methylated spirit to clear any salt deposits. 
     During winter use meths only.

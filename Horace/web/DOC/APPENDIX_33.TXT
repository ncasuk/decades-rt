Principles of Operation

Sample air is drawn through an H2S scrubber, which removes H2S from the
sample, and into the detector block by means of a vacuum pump.  Hydrogen is
supplied under a slight pressure from an external cylinder.  When sulphur
species are burnt in a hydrogen flame chemiluminescence occurs at around
394nm.  This wavelength is detected using a combination of a narrow band
filter and a photomultiplier.  The output from the photomultiplier is
amplified to produce the output on the meter dial which is proportional to the
amount of SO2 in the air sample.

Pre-Flight

1.   Allow TWO HOURS BEFORE Take-off for the instrument to warm up.
2.   ZERO and SPAN potentiometers should NOT be adjusted.
3.   The TIME CONSTANT switch should be left on 1sec for normal operation.
4.   DISCONNECT the sample line (the only 1/8th inch pipe on port air sampling
     pipe) and CONNECT the ZERO FILTER.
     NB. the ZERO FILTER removes SO2 from the ambient air and also dries it.
5.   Power to the instrument should be turned ON and the 230V CB MADE.
6.   Switch the POWER switch ON.
7.   Adjust H2 FLOW ADJUST to its lowest reading and wait until this falls to
     zero.
8.   Switch the RANGE switch to 100 for normal operation.
9.   Turn the valve on the hydrogen cylinder ON and pressurize to 50lb/in2.
10.  Check the hydrogen cylinder for leaks with `snoop'.
11.  Adjust the H2 FLOW ADJUST to 46mm.
12.  The flame in the burner should light automatically - indicated by a kick
     on the METER DIAL and the IGNITION light being OFF.
     If the IGNITION light is ON this is a warning that the flame is NOT
     alight - there is a fail safe auto cut-out for the hydrogen supply.
13.  If the flame does not light automatically it can be lit manually by
     pressing IN the IGNITION light for about 1 minute - indicated by a kick
     on the METER DIAL and the IGNITION light being off when released.
14.  A pre-flight tape of the zero readings should be made - see data logger
     instructions.
15.  NOTE the zero reading on the meter dial and the H2 flow reading.
16.  Half-an-hour before take-off DISCONNECT the ZERO FILTER and RE-CONNECT
     the sample line.
17.  Switch the power and then hydrogen supply OFF before take-off.

                                                                 4 Sept 1989
In-Flight

1.   After take-off switch ON the hydrogen supply and then the power and
     re-light at about 3000ft.  The instrument will not remain alight above
     9000ft, above this level - the power and hydrogen supply should be turned
     OFF. 
2.   The instrument should NOT be run WITHOUT the hydrogen supply being ON as
     this will burn out the igniter.
3.   It will be necessary to adjust the RANGE switch to 500 when the meter is
     occasionally reading off-scale on the 100 range.  These occasions should
     be noted on the log sheet.
4.   At the end of experimental flight a high level zero is required:
     At approximately 7000ft DISCONNECT SAMPLE LINE and CONNECT ZERO FILTER
     run for about 5 minutes.
5.   Before landing or at end of experimental flight turn the power then the
     hydrogen supply OFF.

NOTE:  A full bottle of hydrogen contains about 1500lb/in2, which should be
enough for 3 flights - each flight using about 300lb/in2.  If far more than
this is used a leak in the system is indicated, the power and then the
hydrogen should be switched OFF.

The tubing of the instrument can become `dirty' this is indicated by a long
response time (the SO2 normally has a fast response time).

\section{Abstract}

\section{Setting up your development environment}
\subsection{Preparation}
You will need access to the DECADES git\cite{git} revision control repository. You will also need
a Linux development box. The deployment tanks are running the Ubuntu LTS\cite{ubuntu-lts} 
distribution, but any Debian-derived distribution will probably work.

\subsubsection{Checkout the source code}
You will need to contact FAAM with your public key to allow access. Once that is done:
{\tt git clone git@77.68.61.13:/decades-rt }

will create a working copy of the repository in the current directory.




\section{Versioning}
To increment the version number you need to:

Edit the python module version number in:
{\tt setup.py}

Tag the Git repository with the new version number:

{\tt git tag -a 0.9.0 -m 'Version 0.9.0'}
{\tt git push --tags }

Make the release and deploy:

{\tt RELEASE=yes fab -H fish,septic deploy }

You will be ofered the chance to edit the change log. Change the number on the top line to match the release number.

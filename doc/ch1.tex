{\small\em An approach to testing the DECADES server in cases where no live data are available}
\end{center}

\section{Abstract}
An approach is described to allow the testing of the Server element of the application is isolation using a Python script
which simulates incoming data to replace the Listener element.

\section{Procedure}
\subsection{Stop the Listener element} 
Locate the decades-listener process, and kill it: 

\texttt{ \$ sudo kill `sudo cat /var/run/decades-listener.pid`}

\subsection{Start the database simulator}
Change directory to the decades pylib dir:

\texttt{ \$ cd /usr/local/lib/decades/pylib/}

Start the database simulator:

\texttt{ \$ ./database-simulator.py }

This replaces the UDP Listener element with simulated data.

\subsection{Run clients}
On a machine connected to same network as the tanks, go to

\texttt{http://fish/plot/plot.html} 

or

\texttt{http://septic/plot/plot.html}

as appropriate, and start various applets monitoring incoming data. (Not all values are simulated; for a full list, see \texttt{ /usr/local/lib/decades/pylib/database-simulator.py }, line 25)

\section{Monitoring}
As you increase the number of clients, you can monitor the effect on the tabk machine by running the command \texttt{ top} and looking for processes called \texttt{ twistd}.

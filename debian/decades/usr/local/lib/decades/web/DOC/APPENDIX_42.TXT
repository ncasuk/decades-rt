                       SEADAS OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS

PRE-FLIGHT OPERATION

It is normal to check the operation of probes fitted before flight.  This is
carried out in accordance with the current safety procedures.  Only personnel
authorised by the AIRCRAFT MANAGER may book out the keys and operate the
SEADAS system.

At present five keys will need to be drawn from the Aircraft Managers office,
and these are held in a transparent case.  From the same office sufficient
2D operators logs should also be collected as well as a pair of safety
goggles.  Exabyte tapes (Sony Video 8) can be collected from the tape store
(suggest 3 tapes) as well as the SEADAS hard disk failure floppy disks.

There are three mounting pods on the port wing for PMS probes.  As there are
now four types of PMS probes available, we run either a large fit or a small
fit.  With the large fit the precipitation probe is fitted, whilst the small
fit has the PCASP.

Transport the 2D caravan out to the pan and set up the safety notices in
accordance with current safety procedures.  Place the FSSP calibration
equipment on the safety raiser and connect the mains extension lead to the
aircraft 240V supply (H043, lower 240 O/P - disconnect the Barnes temporary). 
Connect the vacuum cleaner pipe to the rear of the sampling tube after fitting
the droplet generator to the sampling arms of the FSSP.  Turn on the vacuum
cleaner and adjust the flow valve to about 50.  Make sure there is sufficient
water and now air trapped in the feeder pipe.

Mae the circuit breakers on JB6 (the nearest to the SEADAS), these being 2D
KNOL CONTROL, PMS EQUIP, 2DP PROBE, 2DC PROBE, FSSP 100, CLOUD PHYSICS
MONITOR.  Turn on the monitor and SEADAS and open up the keyboard using the
relevant key.  Insert the correct laser keys into the switching unit and turn
the probes on.  Select option A (for small fit) or option B (for large fit). 
After the operational software has loaded a gaussian distribution should be
seen on the operators FSSP XY plot of counts against size.  Using the safety
goggles move a finger through the cloud (and if fitted, the precipitation)
probe sampling arms and observe whether the SEADAS 2D image display(s) has
updated.  If the PCASP is fitted use the command "cmd1d 1 1" to start the
motor.  A distribution should then be seen on the operators PCASP XY plot of
counts against size.  As soon as the operation of the PCASP is confirmed use
the command "cmd1d 1 0" to stop the motor so that it doesn't overheat.

If no problems are encountered then the system may be switched off, and the
circuit breakers broken.  Return the laser keys back to their carrying case. 
Lock the keyboard try closed and return to the carrying case also.  Stow all
objects for flight and remove the water droplet generator and associated
equipment back into the caravan which should be returned to the covered area.

If problems are encountered then notify the Aircraft Manager and seek advice
from the Cloud Physics section.

                                                                 9 July 1990

FLIGHT OPERATION

The system should be switched on as detailed in PRE-FLIGHT OPERATION.  As soon
as possible place an Exabyte tape into its drive by pressing the eject button
on the drive after it has warmed up (green light on).  Place the cartridge
into the drive and close the mechanism.  It is useful to set the SEADAS time
to that of the DRS clock.  To do this select option T and place the correct
time in the suggested format.  At the correct instance press enter.

If the transit period is going to be very short then it would be best to
select the operational software (option C or D), otherwise select the correct
pre-flight option which will give the Exabyte drive further time to warm up. 
If the software fails to run then reselect the option.

You are expected to keep a written log as well as enter comments on the
command line of the SEADAS.  Remember not to type in STOP or QUIT as the start
of any comments you may make.  All the commands you may make are listed with
examples on separate sheets to this notice.  It is important to enter the DRS
time as a comment particularly if you didn't have a chance to correct the
systems clock before recording took place.  You should do this at the
beginning and the end of the recorded data.

You will not need to use all the commands listed on the separate sheets.  The
most important ones are the formulae changes and strip and XY plot changes. 
To change the TAS from the default value to say 125 M/S then enter fml 1 125
on the command line.  To change the A number use formula 10. eg. fml 10 15
will give A 15.  If the small fit is used then it is necessary to specify the
height used formula 6, eg. fml 6 1000 gives 1000ft.  For strip chart limit
changes you must use the correct strip chart number as shown on the sheets
provided (eg. stp 22 lim 0 100 will change the limits to 0 to 100 on the 2D-C
MEAN DIA strip chart on the operators screen - large fit only).  Similarly for
XY charts select the right number.  Also remember for XY plots that you can
change both axis, so use xlim or ylim as appropriate.

Errors occurring on the new system should not fail the programme but list the
occurrence on the command line and in more detail in the error window.  Be
very suspicious if errors start occurring after you have changed a limit on an
XY plot as you may not have noticed it was a logarithmic scale.  Please note
the error on the log sheet as well as informing the aircraft scientist.

There are forty possible macros available.  These string commands together at
a push of a button (or two).  Some of the macros are common to the large and
small fits, others are not.  A listing for each of the different fits can be
found on separate sheets.  One important macro is the one that controls the
FSSP range.  The FSSP has four ranges:

     range 0   particle sizes 2 - 47æ dia press F10
     range 1   particle sizes 2 - 32æ dia press SHIFT_F10
     range 2   particle sizes 1 - 16æ dia press CTRL_F10
     range 3   particle sizes « -  8æ dia press ALT_F10

                                                                 9 July 1990
COMMAND PROCESSING

The Model 200 provides a set of commands to control system functions.  These
are entered from the keyboard during operation.

FORMULA COMMANDS:

FML  FML VALUE           Formula override.  Set old value of formula to value
                         specified.
FML  AUTO                Return formula to auto value.

EXAMPLE:
     fml 10 356          Set the value of formula 10 to 356.

FML?  FML [ INDEX]       Query value of formula.  Index is optional and is
                         only used if the formula is an array of values.

EXAMPLE:
     fml? 30             Display the value of formula 30 in query part of the
                         command window.
     fml? 34 3           Display the value of the 3rd element of formula 34 in
                         query part of the command window.

GENERAL COMMANDS:

QUIT                     Terminates acquisition, with rewind.
STOP                     Terminates acquisition, without rewind.
CMD1D  PRB CMD           Command byte (value).

EXAMPLE:
     cmd1d 1 cmd         Get 1D command byte from probe 1.

REARM  BUF FREQ          Change async buffer rearm rate.  Note this is the
                         buffer number from the acquisition table, not the
                         probe number.

EXAMPLE:
     rearm 0 10          Change the rearm rate of probe 0 to 10.

SCN  SCN CMD             Choose screen where commands will be active.

EXAMPLE:
     scn 1 cmd           Select screen 1 to be active.

FILE ON                  Turn on storage to device (disc).
FILE OFF                 Turn off storage to device (disc).

EXAMPLE:
     file on             Storage of data will be done.

The default range is 0 and for most large fit applications this is fine. 
However, consult the aircraft scientist as he may wish you to keep to the
lowest size range possible.  This may mean you will have to change the range
regularly so as not to exclude larger particles.
                                     -3-

                                                                 APPENDIX 42
                                                                 9 July 1990

When the scientific sortie has finished use the command QUIT which will rewind
and eject the Exabyte tape.  Place this tape into its case and mark it as a
SEADAS TAPE and include the A number and date.  If several apes were used then
mark it as tape 1 or whatever.  It is worth pointing out that if you make an
error such as exiting the programme accidentally then eject the present
Exabyte tape and insert a fresh tape before running the M200 programme. 
Switch off the system and break the circuit breakers.  Place the keys back
into their carrying case remembering to lock the keyboard first.  Stow all
loose objects for landing.

After landing give the flight leader a copy of the log and the Exabyte tape. 
Sign back the keys in the Aircraft Managers office and place the hard disk
failure floppy disks as well as any spare Exabyte tapes back in the cupboard
in the tape store.

SYSTEM FAILURES

You will notice that on occasion that when you try to run the M200 programme
it does not work, but jumps out to the option page.  In this case simply
resubmit the option.

It has been known for the hard disk to fail.  On these occasions a message to
that effect is displayed.  Select a suitable disk from the hard disk failure
pack and insert into the appropriate drive located above the Exabyte drive. 
Pressing F2 loads the operational software.  Remember to remove the floppy
disk before switching off the power.

Sometimes, particularly after just starting, the display freezes.  The
indicator lights on the SEADAS will show a wait state and a storage problem. 
Usually the problem will clear within a minute.  If it has not cleared after
two minutes, reboot.  Of course if this has occured sometime into the flight
you must use a new tape.

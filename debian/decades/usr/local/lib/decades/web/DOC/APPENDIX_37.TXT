OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 
This appendix includes all the important information required to switch on/off
the CVI and its in flight operation. For more detailed information, including
principles of operation and more detailed in flight instructions, contact the
cloud physics section of MRF for an enhanced copy of this appendix.

It is strongly advised that a new operator becomes familiar with the content of
this and the enhanced appendix befor attempting to operate the CVI, as damage
to the instrument can easily occur dur to an error in operation.


Principles Of Operation
The CVI is a device designed to collect cloud droplets by removing them from
the airflow and evaporating off the water to leave a residual particle and
water vapour.
 
This is done by inertial impaction of the cloud droplet against a dry clean
stream of air blowing out of the probe tip: the counter flow. alternatively, in
cloud free air the counter flow  may be switched off. This will allow aerosol
particles to be sampled. The residual particles or aerosols are then carried in
a sample flow into a plenum chamber. Here the flow is divided between various
instrument and filter packages, allowing the particles to be counted  and
analysed.
 

PRE FLIGHT
 
Outside the Aircraft
1. Remove all blanks.
2. Check nothing is blocking the probe tip.
3. Check Tip locking wire intact.
 
 
Inside the Aircraft 
1. To avoid damage to any of the instruments on the CVI, ensure that all circuit
   breakers on the CVI power distribution box are pulled (OFF), before making
   any aircraft circuit breakers to the CVI. This should prevent any
   inadvertent switching on of pumps etc, that may cause substantial internal
   damage, and force leaks and fractures in the pipework.

2. Check to see if dessicant requires changing.
   DRIERITE should be blue in both canisters, if not then requires changing. 
   - Dessicant may be changed by releasing the "Swagelok" fittings at each end
   of the canisters. Each canister is secured to the bottom shelf by holding
   blocks. These may be split to allow removal of the Drierite canister by
   undoing the four retaining bolts, two in each block. The tops of each 
   canister may then be unscrewed, and the Drierite changed. The old Drierite 
   may be returned to the Lab for drying. Refitting is the reverse procedure. 
   Do not over tighten the "Swagelok" fittings as damage and a poor seal will 
   result.
 
 
Switching on the CVI
On CVI Power Distribution Box:
1. 230 VAC 50Hz Set "Power Switch" to On (UP)...Top Right.
2. Make Computer Circuit Breaker (POWER MAC).
3. Make SCXI 1000 Circuit Breaker.
 
On Macintosh Computer:
1. Power up using button on top of Keyboard. Should make the sound of a bell
   chime if successful.
    - It has been shown that best practice on initial power up, is to make all
     the required C.B.s and switch on the SCXI and power up the MAC. Then leave
     the MAC to warm up for 5 or so minutes. It has been found that the boot up
     will probably have hung at some stage, but after allowing 5 minutes,
     pressing the RESET button will normally result in a trouble free boot up.
 
2. If power up fails, push the Reset button on the right hand side of the
   computer, (the front one of the two buttons).

 
On CVI Power Distribution Box:
1. Make CPC Circuit Breaker:
   - Check Instrument comes on.
2. Make OPC Circuit Breaker:
   - Check Instrument is on;
   - Wait a few seconds and then check flows;
   - Check for Lasing by checking reference voltage is greater than 6V.
3. Set "400Hz Power" Switch to On (UP)....Bottom Right.
4. Set "15 V DC Power" Switch to On (UP)..Upper Bottom Left.
5. Set "28 V DC Power" Switch to On (UP)..Bottom Center
 

Initialising the Computer
NOTE: The MOUSE has been set up so that the left hand button when clicked
      represents a single click. The right hand mouse button has been set up so
      that a click represents a double click. Clicking both button together has
      the effect of HOLD.
 
1. Check time on Computer V's DRS time.
   If wrong, set correct time by:
   - Under Apple icon scroll down to Control panel;
   - Scroll to Date and Time option on this menu;
   - To set time/date, over type correct value, then click on "close file"
     "button" to set.
 
2. Start Snoopy Program:
   - Use mouse to click on Apple icon, then scroll down to SNOOPY:
   - Press RETURN when get USER LOGIN panel.
3. Click on "BYPASS" control "button" on main screen, from OFF to ON.
				C.V.I.				Appendix 37
4. Click on "Update Filters" control button on the main screen from OFF to ON.
5. Toggle "RUN SWITCH" to pre-start the program.
6. Press the ARROW icon on the left hand side of the  menu bar to start the
   program.
   This gives a "File Dialogue" screen7. Save Log File in Data Folder by:
   - On this screen, click on the ANTARES box, this should temporarily go black
     and the main menu screen should change;
   - In the main screen, click on DATA (now the top item in the screen);
   - In the box below the main screen, type in the name of the data file to be
     written to, e.g. YYMMDD.LOG;
   - Click on OK to set.

8. Start logging data by clicking on "LOG DATA" button:
   - A text string should appear in the "Latest Data File" box, next to the
     "Log Data" button.
9. From Apple Icon scroll down to "Read Serial VI";
   A screen should then pop up:
   - Write "SI 2" in the "String To Write" box;
   - Click on "add <CR>";
   - Click on "Write String".
   - Check to see that the strings are correct by:
   - In the top right hand box ( "PRINTER PORT" ), the string from HORACE
     should be here, and it should start with a "S_", and end with "_z";
   - In the middle right hand box ( "Modem Port" ), the string from the OPC
     should be here, and it should start with a date and end with channel
     values (usual for a 0.00 to be in the last channel);
   - Return to SNOOPY Program by clicking on the Apple Menu and scrolling down
     to SNOOPY, OR Going to SNOOPY by scrolling down the WINDOWS option on the
     main menu bar. Do Not close the "read serial VI " screen as frequent
     reference to this screen needs to be made in flight.

 
Checking OPC and HORACE Signals
On start up and during operation in flight, frequent checks have to be made to
ensure that the OPC and HORACE signals and correct. This may be carried out
by:
1. On the SNOOPY screen examine the Bytes at Printer port and bytes at MODEM
   port boxes:
   - Printer Port = HORACE and should change between 0 and 41;
   - Modem Port = OPC and should change between 0 and 225 every 2 seconds (as
     this signal is read every 2 seconds at the port).
2. The signal from the OPC may also be checked by looking at the OPC histogram.
   - There should be higher values in the lower channels with a peak close to
     channel 5;
   - If there are no readings at the lowest channels, and a peak at high
     channels, then check the signal from the OPC (MODEM PORT).
3. If the signals (bytes) are wrong, then try clicking on the "Update Serial
   Settings" button on the SNOOPY screen.

4. If this does not clear the problem, then try:
   - Goto READ SERIAL VIs by scrolling down to READ SERIAL VI from the WINDOWS
     option on the main menu bar;
(String for OPC should start with a date or time.
 String for HORACE should have a capital letter as the first and last value in
 the string if in sync. )
   - type in "SI 10" in the "String to Write" box;
   - Click on " add <CR>";
   - Click on "Write String"
   - Return to SNOOPY by clicking on the Apple Menu and scrolling down to
     SNOOPY, OR Going to SNOOPY by scrolling down the WINDOWS option on the
     main menu bar;
   - Click on "Update Serial Settings".
5. If only HORACE or OPC are missing, then under the Apple Icon scroll down
   to Chooser. Here check that AppleTalk is OFF.
6. If only HORACE is out of sync, if not reading 41,  then try:
   - Goto READ SERIAL VIs by scrolling down to READ SERIAL VI from the WINDOWS
     option on the main menu bar;
   - Change the settings in the left most part of the display to:
     PORT = PRINTER
     PARITY = NONE
   - Return to SNOOPY by clicking on the Apple Menu and scrolling down to
     SNOOPY, OR Going to SNOOPY by scrolling down the WINDOWS option on the
     main menu bar;
   - Click on "Update Serial Settings".
   - If this works, go back to the Read Serial VI's screen and change the
     settings back to the default of:
     PORT = MODEM
     PARITY = EVEN.
 
 
On CVI Power Distribution Box: 
1. Make Vacuum Pump Circuit Breaker:
   - Check for flow by looking at CNC Sample Flow on the main SNOOPY panel, it
     should read about 1.
   - Check CNC measuring particles.
2. Make FAN P PUMP(Pressure Pump Fan)  Circuit Breaker.
3. Set Pressure Pump switch to ON (UP)...Center Left:
   - Check "L CONTROL" value on SNOOPY screen is set to 5;
   - Check Pressure Gauge at Regulator (On bottom tray) is reading between
     15 and 30, if not then check pressure pump switch set correctly and 230V
     power is available. If pump still fails to operate, seek advice from
     MRF ;
   - Check to see that the particle concentration [Ncnc] comes down to less
     than 1, and preferably close to 0.
 
4. Make Temperature Control CVI Circuit Breaker:
   - Check that thermostats come on (Tip, Sample and Flow).
5. Set Heater switch to ON (UP)...Lower Bottom Left.
6. Check flows on the OPC:
   - Sample Flow around 1 cm³/s¹
   - Sheath Flow around 20cm³/s¹
 

Filters 
1. Check ALL clamps pinched off on mounting/dismounting.
2. Install filters, face down, outlet on top.
3. Open Clamps before exposure.
4. To prevent blowing the filters due to the pressure differential between ground
   level when they were loaded, and operating height, open the clamps on the
   CVI pipes after power change over, when the CVI is operating in CVI mode  (to
   prevent contamination). When exposing the filter, remove the two filter
   clamps SLOWLY! This should hopefully work.
 
See notes in the enhanced appendix (available from the cloud physics section of
MRF) for full filter operating instructions, and notes on how to preset the 
filter selection using the soft ware.
 

TSI 3010 CPC 
1. Pre flight the amount of working fluid (n-butyle alcohol (butonol)) in the
   CPC need to be checked.
2. If the LIQUID light on the front panel of the CPC does not light after warm
   up then the instrument requires refilling.
3. On the front panel of the CPC there is a clear window through which the
   butonol reservoir may be visually checked. If fluid can be seen, then there
   should be enough butonol for the sortie.
4. Filling the CPC should be done in accordance with the instructions laid out
   below under The Instrument Fit: TSI 3010 CPC.
  

 
PRE FLIGHT POWER CHANGE OVER
 
The CVI needs to be powered down for the change from external to aircraft
power.  This is to be started as the GTC is started.
 
SHUT DOWN FOR POWER TRANSFER
 
1. On SNOOPY screen, Stop logging by clicking on the "LOG DATA" button and
   changing it to OFF, and Close the data file by clicking on the "CLOSE DATA
   FILE" button.
 
On CVI Power Distribution Box:
1.  Vacuum Pump C.B.             OFF
2.  OPC C.B.                     OFF
3.  Heater Switch                OFF (Down)
4.  Temperature Controllers C.B. OFF
5.  Pressure Pump Switch         OFF (Down)
6.  Fan P Pump C.B.              OFF
7.  CPC C.B.                     OFF
 
When Pressure Gauge on bottom shelf falls to 0, then:
8.  15VDC switch                 OFF  (Down)
9.  28VDC switch                 OFF  (Down)
10. 400Hz switch                 OFF  (Down)
 
On Macintosh Computer
Switch off Snoopy by:
1. Toggling the Run "SWITCH" to OFF
2. Goto FILE icon and scroll down to QUIT
              OR
   Click on the Close File "Button"
3. Under SPECIAL Icon, scroll down to "SHUT DOWN" and release cursor.
Wait until screen goes blank.
 
On CVI Power Distribution Box:
1.  SCXI C.B.                   OFF
2.  Computer C.B.               OFF
3.  230VAC switch               OFF (Down)
 
**** REPORT TO FLIGHT LEADER THAT CVI IS READY FOR POWER CHANGE OVER ****
 


After Power Change-over
WHEN CLEARED BY THE FLIGHT LEADER AFTER POWER CHANGE OVER,SWITCH THE C.V.I. 
BACK ON AS DETAILED ABOVE, MAKING SURE TO SET THE L VALUE TO 5 - 6 CM
TO STOP CONTAMINATION ON TAKE OFF.
 
****  ONCE READY FOR TAXI REPORT TO FLIGHT LEADER ****
 
 

                       
IN FLIGHT OPERATION
                    
After Take-off
1. Check the OPC and CNC are working, counting particles, laser reference
   voltage greater than 6V on the OPC.
2. Check the operating program (SNOOPY) is working and the OPC and HORACE
   signals are correct, as laid out above.
3. Check that the flow through the filters is going through the BYPASS valve:
   All filters OFF on the control panel, apart from number 1 (BYPASS).
4. Check flows on the OPC:
   - Sample Flow around 1 cm³/s¹
   - Sheath Flow around 20cm³/s¹
   These may require minor adjustment with changes in altitude and TAS, and
   should be monitored throughout the flight.

5. An in flight log should be kept of all significant events, run start and
   end, if flying in or below cloud, OPC and CPC figures with corresponding
   values from the PMS kit etc. This is done by typing in the comment in the
   messages box (bottom center) on the Snoopy front panel. The message is
   recorded when the return key is pressed, or the log message icon is pressed.
   The message window should then be cleared for the next message to be typed
   in. Note that it is not necessary to have "Log Data" on to record these
   messages, as they go in a seperate file.
 
6. Filters. See notes below about selection of filters. This will be decided
   upon pre flight by the aircraft scientist. When not in use, (filters should
   be clamped off), and the flow directed through BYPASS. When filters are
   selected, they should be unclamped, and the filters required selected from
   the Snoopy front panel as set out below. A note should then be made in the
   log of the exposure time, both start and end time, and elapsed time for each
   filter or groups of filters.
   Experience has shown that to prevent the filters popping in flight due to
   the differential pressure between cabin, ambient, and sea level, (where the
   filters were loaded and clamped off,) that once the CVI is established in CVI
   mode after power transfer, the filters should be unclamped. As the
   instrument is in CVI mode there should be no contamination, plus at this
   stage, the flow should be routed through BYPASS.
   Filters are selected by clicking on the selection box on the front panel.
   They are usually grouped in pairs, one pair above, in, and below cloud. A
   note of which filter pairs are being used should be kept.
   While the aircraft in manoeuvring at the end of a run, the flow should be
   routed through BYPASS. For this reason, the CVI operator, should note the
   length of each run as called by the Navigator, Flight Leader or Aircraft
   Scientist, and start exposure of the filters about one minute into the start
   of the run. They should then aim to route the flow through BYPASS from a
   time one minute to the end of the run, so there will be no flows through the
   filters when the aircraft is not is straight an level flight. On quiet
   sorties, the Flight Leader may have time to call one minute into the start
   of the run, and the navigator able to call one minute to the end, but this
   can not be relied upon, so the CVI operator must make provision for keeping
   track of the elapsed and remaining time of any run.
 
7. In areas of precipitation, or when in cloud where drizzle size droplets are
   present, be aware of the possibility of droplet shattering in the probe tip
   artificially increasing the number of residuals (droplets) counted by the
   CVI. This will be evident due to a substantially larger count on the CPC than
   the OPC.
8. Check that the LATEST DATA FILE screen is updating every 5 minutes. The
   software is set up to open a new data file every 5 minutes, and the date 
   and time this file was opened should be displayed in this screen.
9. Check the displayed values for Ambient Temperature and Pressure against that
   read off HORACE. Note that whilst on the ground, there will be no
   temperature information from Horace.
10.Unless requested by the aircraft scientist, the CVI must be in CVI mode
   before entering cloud, or areas of heavy atmospheric pollution, to avoid
   contamination.
11.Check the flow through the CNC is around 1.0 as shown on the snoopy front
   panel. (Marked as CNC Sample in the center of the screen) This may vary with
   altitude and TAS. Large deviations from this figure should be noted. If the
   flow drops, then comparisons between the CNC and PCASP/FSSP will be poor,
   and the enhancement factor will be in error.
 
    

PRE LANDING CHECKS
1. Switch off all filters.
2. All filter pipes clamped.
3. On Snoopy screen, set BYPASS to On.
4. Set L control to 5-6 cm. This is IMPORTANT to prevent contamination !!!!!
5. Report to Flight Leader that CVI ready for Landing.
 
AFTER LANDING CHECKS
Before Power Change over, Carry out the controlled shut down as set out above.
in the  "Shut Down for Power Transfer" Instructions
 
IN ADDITION, IF THE CVI IS NOT TO BE POWERED UP AGAIN AFTER THE TRANSFER, THE
AIRCRAFT CIRCUIT BREAKERS NEED TO BE PULLED.
 
On JB3B BRAKE the following Circuit Breakers:
1. 28V DC  EPDB CONTROL. 3Amp.
2. 28V DC  CVI PROBE. 3Amp.
 
On JB12 (EPDB 12) PULL the following Circuit Breakers & Switches (UP):
1. 200 V 400 Hz. 3ph.  Monitor and CB Panel:         CB 2: CVI. 5Amp.

5. 230 V  50 Hz. 1ph.      "        "    " "    "    SWITCH 230V OUTPUT.
 
REPORT TO FLIGHT LEADER WHEN SHUT DOWN AND READY FOR POWER TRANSFER.
             ---------------------------------------------------


After Power Transfer the files should be transferred onto floppy disk or
preferably onto an optical disk. Instructions on how to do this appear
below.
 
POST FLIGHT TRANSFER OF DATA.
 
FLOPPY DISKS.
If using floppies, then need to format them either before or after flight on
the Mac. Insert disk, a menu will then pop up if unformatted, just follow the
instructions.
 
To prevent copying a lot of space to the floppy disks, it is best to compress
the data first. This is done using the Stuffit software on the Mac.
1. Exit Snoopy in the usual way.
2. On the menu bar goto Utilities.
3. Find the Stuffit icon and double click on it.
4. A window will open with a list of options. To compress the data open a new 
   folder, the software will provide the extension .sit.
5. Select the data to be compressed by selecting the folder..usually data..
   and highlighting the files to be compressed. Holding the mouse button down
   highlights the files to be compressed in the left hand box, then click on
   select in the middle to place the selected files in the right hand box.
6. Once all the required files have been selected, click on the STUFF icon.
7. This compressed data file(s) may then be copied to disk or optical as laid
   out below.
8. Exit Stuffit by clicking on the close file icon.
 
To copy data display list of data files created on that flight.
Then "drag and Drop" from data file name to floppy disk icon.
Should create one data file per 5 minutes of flight. Each file being around
180K ish ish. So will need 2 or 3 floppies per flight, with a lot of time and
patience.
 
OPTICAL DISKS.
Data from the CVI may be compressed then copied onto an optical disk. Ths
optical disk drive should be plugged into the scussy port on the left hand side
of the Mac. The disk should be initialised if not done so previously, and the
data coppied across by highlighting the files and dragging and dropping onto
the optic dirve icon, in a similar manner to copying files to disk.

Another Mac.
Files may also be copied onto a laptop or other Mac. The other machine is
plugged into the port on the left hand side of the Mac. 

WHEN FINNISHED WITH THE C.V.I. CARRY OUT AN ORDERLY SHUT DOWN AS DETAILED IN
"SHUT DOWN FOR POWER TRANSFER". THEN PULL ALL AIRCRAFT CIRCUIT BREAKERS AND
SWITCHES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CVI, AND SHUT DOWN JB12 (EPDB 12) IF NO OTHER
INSTRUMENTS ARE USING POWER FROM THIS BOX. REPORT TO FLIGHT LEADER WHEN THIS IS
DONE, OR IF ASSISTANCE IS REQUIRED IN LOCATING AND/OR OPERATING THE AIRCRAFT
CIRCUIT BREAKERS. 


                    
OPERATING THE CVI

Modes Of Operation 
 
The CVI fitted to the MRF Hercules aircraft may be operated in one of two
modes: CVI or Aerosol.
 
CVI MODE :-  In this mode, a counter flow airstream flows out of the probe tip.
Inside the tip there is a stagnation zone where the carrier gas flow separates,
some flowing out of the tip as counter flow, and some back into the instrument
as sample flow. To be sampled, a particle must pass through the counter flow and
the stagnation zone. The further the stagnation zone is from the probe tip, the
larger the cut off size of the particles able to be sampled. The distance
from the probe tip to the stagnation zone is called the "L" value. As a cloud
droplet passes through the counter flow air and the stagnation zone it is
virtually impacted against this air flow. This evaporates off any cloud water,
leaving a residual CN particle and water vapour, which then passes into the
instrument in the sample flow for analysis.
To set the CVI into CVI mode, switch on both Pressure and Vacuum pumps on the
CVI power distribution box, and wait until the pressure as read off the gauge
on the bottom shelf reads above about 15. Then set the L value as set out
below, or previously determined in flight. Until a good feel for the CVI's
characteristics has been obtained, best practice would be to reset the L value
as laid out below, when switching back from aerosol mode.

 
AEROSOL MODE :- In this mode, the carrier gas is switched off. Hence there is
no counter flow out of the probe tip, and therefore no stagnation zone or "L"
value to set. In this mode aerosol sized particles or droplets are freely
sampled into the CVI. The cutoff size being determined by the airflow into and
around the probe tip, and the pumped flow rate of the sample flow.
To set the CVI into Aerosol mode, switch the Pressure Pump OFF on the CVI power
distribution box. This cuts off the carrier gas flow. The pressure gauge on the
bottom shelf will fall to zero, indicating that there is no air being forced
out of the probe by the pumps, and that the CVI is now in AEROSOL MODE. A valve
upstream of the pump prevents aircraft cabin air which will be at a greater
pressure than ambient, flowing out through the probe, and contaminating the
system.
The usual mode of operation is CVI MODE.
 
 
SETTING THE "L" VALUE
To enable the CVI to sample only cloud particle residuals, there must be a
flow of clean, dry, filtered counter flow air, coming out of the probe tip.
If this flow is too large, only the larger aerosol particles will be sampled,
while too low a counter flow, may lead to contamination.
  For this reason, the L value needs to be set in flight. The L value being the
distance from the probe tip to the stagnation zone inside the probe tip. (For
further detail on this see Principles of Operation below.)
  On take off to prevent contamination, the L value is set as high as possible,
so that as much of the counter flow air goes out of the probe tip. If the
instrument is to be operated in CVI mode, then the L value appropriate to the
airspeed and required cloud droplet cut off size needs to be set. The L value
is displayed in the right hand bar display labeled L INDICATOR, and it may be
varied by moving the slide control on the left hand L CONTROL bar display, or
by clicking on the increase, or decrease arrows next to the numeric read out.
 
Set the L value by:
1.Flying in a cloud free, low aerosol airmass. For example, in the free
  troposphere above any boundary layer cloud.
2.Switch the EF (Enhancement Factor) OFF
3.On the CVI front panel, reduce the "L CONTROL" slide control until the numeric
  display and histogram for the CNC is stable below 1.0. Once this value has
  stabilised for say 30 seconds, then increase this value by 0.3. In theory in
  an aerosol free  airmass, it should be possible to reduce the number of CNC to
  zero. Totally clean airmasses are rarely found, so a compromise value of less
  than 1 is acceptable.
 
Once set the L value should remain untouched while the aircraft is in the same
local airmass. It should be reset if there is a change in airmass types, or the
CVI has been operated in Aerosol mode. In general, the L value need only be set
a couple of times in a flight, unless the operator feels more is needed.
 

ENHANCEMENT FACTOR
The EF or Enhancement Factor is switched on when flying in CVI mode,
and is a correction applied to the displayed data from the OPC and CNC.

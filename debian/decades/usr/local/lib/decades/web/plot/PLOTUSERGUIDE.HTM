<p>
There are two types of plots available, Derived Data, and Raw Data.
</p>
<h4>Derived Data</h4>
<p>
These are plots of parameters in scientific units ( using a minimal calibration
in the HORACE routines).  There are several different types of plot.
<ul><b>XY plot</b> - a plot of one or more dependant Y varaible against one 
indepentant X variable.  eg a Time Series plot.</ul>
<ul><b>YX plot</b> - a plot of one or more dependant X varaible against one 
indepentant Y variable. eg a Profile plot.</ul>
<ul><b>Tephigram</b> - a meteorological T-phi diagram</ul>
<ul><b>Hodograph</b> - a polar plot of wind strengths and directions.</ul>
<ul><b>Track Plot</b> - a plot of Lat and Long over a map.</ul>
<ul><b>Text</b> - a dump of a list of parameters.</ul>
<p>
Choose one of these options, then choose which parameters to plot.  You can 
also choose the time period to plot ( by default the last 1/2 hour ) and the
symbols to plot with.  Then press the <b>Plot</b> button.
</p>
<p>
A new window should pop up with the plot in it.  The plot can be zoomed in on
by 
selecting a rectangle with the mouse, to zoom out again use the right mouse
button.
</p>
<h4>Raw Data</h4>
Raw data still in DRS units is treated differently.  Only Time series plots are
available,
a number can be plotted at once in different colours.  The plot is 'zoomed in'
by 
reducing the number of bits of data displayed, from showing all 16 bits to just
the least
significant 4 bits.  Double-clicking on the plot will reduce the number of bits
shown (
zoom in) right-clcking will increase the number of bits shown (zoom out).
  Each parameter can also be displayed as individual bits ( used for
looking at status words etc ).  It is a rolling plot with the most recent data
replacing
oldest every second.
